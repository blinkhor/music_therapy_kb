        "Abstract":"Background\/Purpose: Although gait disorders occur early in the course of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and increase the risk of falling, methods to improve walking in the home setting are poorly understood. This study aimed to determine the feasibility of a home-based gait training program using rhythmic auditory cues for individuals living with mild to moderately severe AD. Methods: Participants had probable AD with no other major conditions affecting locomotion. The intervention consisted of eight progressively modified 45-min gait training sessions delivered during home visits over 4 weeks. Experienced physiotherapists provided the therapy that incorporated rhythmic music cues for a range of locomotor tasks and ambulatory activities. On the days when the physiotherapist did not attend, participants independently performed a seated music listening activity. Walking speed, cadence, stride length, double limb support duration, and gait variability (coefficient of variation) were measured using an 8-m GAITRite® computerized walkway immediately before and after the physiotherapy intervention. Participant satisfaction was also assessed using a purpose-designed questionnaire. Results: Eleven (median age, 77.0 years; median ACE III score, 66\/100; 3 females and 8 males) community-dwelling adults living with AD participated. Wilcoxon signed rank tests revealed statistically significant increases in gait speed following the home-based physiotherapy intervention (baseline = 117.5 cm\/s, post-intervention = 129.9 cm\/s, z = -2.40, p < 0.05). Stride length also improved (baseline = 121.8 cm, post-intervention = 135.6 cm, z = -2.67, p < 0.05). There was no significant change in gait variability. The program was found to be feasible and safe, with no attrition. Participant satisfaction with the home-based music-cued gait training was high, and there were no adverse events. Conclusion: A progressively modified gait training program using rhythmic auditory cues delivered at home was feasible, safe, and enjoyable. Music-cued gait training can help to reduce the rate of decline in gait stride length and speed in some individuals living with AD.

        "Abstract":"Introduction: Music therapy is one of the types of active ageing programmes which are offered to elderly people. The usefulness of this programme in the field of dementia is beginning to be recognised by the scientific community, since studies have reported physical, cognitive, and psychological benefits. Further studies detailing the changes resulting from the use of music therapy with Alzheimer patients are needed. Objectives: Determine the clinical improvement profile of Alzheimer patients who have undergone music therapy. Patients and methods: Forty-two patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer disease underwent music therapy for 6 weeks. The changes in results on the Mini-mental State Examination, Neuropsychiatric Inventory, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and Barthel Index scores were studied. We also analysed whether or not these changes were influenced by the degree of dementia severity. Results: Significant improvement was observed in memory, orientation, depression and anxiety (HAD scale) in both mild and moderate cases; in anxiety (NPI scale) in mild cases; and in delirium, hallucinations, agitation, irritability, and language disorders in the group with moderate Alzheimer disease. The effect on cognitive measures was appreciable after only 4 music therapy sessions. Conclusions: In the sample studied, music therapy improved some cognitive, psychological, and behavioural alterations in patients with Alzheimer disease. Combining music therapy with dance therapy to improve motor and functional impairment would be an interesting line of research."

        "Abstract":"Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia, affecting millions of older people worldwide. However, pharmacological therapies have not achieved desirable clinical efficacy in the past decades. Non-pharmacological therapies have been receiving increased attention to treat dementia in recent years. Objective: This study explores the effects of music therapy on cognitive function and mental wellbeing of patients with AD. Methods: A total number of 298 AD patients with mild, moderate, or severe dementia participated in the study. The participants with each grade of severity were randomly divided into three groups, which were a singing group, a lyric reading group, and a control group. These three groups received different interventions for three months. All participants underwent a series of tests on cognitive functions, neuropsychological symptoms, and activities of daily living at baseline, three months, and six months. Results: The analysis shows that music therapy is more effective for improving verbal fluency and for alleviating the psychiatric symptoms and caregiver distress than lyrics reading in patients with AD. Stratified analysis shows that music therapy is effective for enhancing memory and language ability in patients with mild AD and reducing the psychiatric symptoms and caregiver distress in patients with moderate or severe AD. However, no significant effect was found for activities of daily living in patients with mild, moderate, or severe AD. Conclusion: This study suggests that music therapy is effective in enhancing cognitive function and mental wellbeing and can be recommended as an alternative approach to manage AD associated symptoms."

Methods: This case-control study was carried out by qualified music therapists in two nursing homes and two psychogeriatric wards. The participants were 38 patients with moderate or severe Alzheimer's disease (AD) assigned randomly to a music therapy group and a control group. Results: The study showed a significant reduction in activity disturbances in the music therapy group during a 6-week period measured with the Behavior Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale (BEHAVE-AD). There was also a significant reduction in the sum of scores of activity disturbances, aggressiveness and anxiety. Other symptoms rated by subscales of the BEHAVE-AD did not decrease significantly. Four weeks later the effects had mostly disappeared. Conclusions: Music therapy is a safe and effective method for treating agitation and anxiety in moderately severe and severe AD. This is in line with the results of some non-controlled studies on music therapy in dementia."

A recent pilot study demonstrated the feasibility and usefulness of a new music therapy technique. The aim of this controlled, randomised study was to assess the effects of this new music therapy technique on anxiety and depression in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer-type dementia. Methods: This was a single-centre, comparative, controlled, randomised study, with blinded assessment of its results. The duration of follow-up was 24 weeks. The treated group (n = 15) participated in weekly sessions of individual, receptive music therapy. The musical style of the session was chosen by the patient. The validated 'U' technique was employed. The control group (n = 15) participated under the same conditions in reading sessions. The principal endpoint, measured at weeks 1, 4, 8, 16 and 24, was the level of anxiety (Hamilton Scale). Changes in the depression score (Geriatric Depression Scale) were also analyzed as a secondary endpoint. Results: Significant improvements in anxiety (p < 0.01) and depression (p < 0.01) were observed in the music therapy group as from week 4 and until week 16. The effect of music therapy was sustained for up to 8 weeks after the discontinuation of sessions between weeks 16 and 24 (p < 0.01). Conclusion: These results confirm the valuable effect of music therapy on anxiety and depression in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. This new music therapy technique is simple to implement and can easily be integrated in a multidisciplinary programme for the management of Alzheimer's disease."

        "Abstract":"Background: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is the early phase of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The aim of early intervention for MCI is to decrease the rate of conversion from MCI to AD. However, the efficacy of multiple interventions in MCI, and the optimal methods of delivery, remain controversial. We aimed to compare and rank the treatment methods for MCI in AD, in order to find an optimal intervention for MCI and a way to prevent or delay the occurrence of AD. Methods: Pair-wise and network meta-analysis were conducted to integrate the treatment effectiveness through direct and indirect evidence. Four English databases and three Chinese databases were searched for international registers of eligible published, single or double blind, randomized controlled trials up to September 31st 2019. We included nine comparative interventions: pharmacological therapies which incorporated cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEI), ginkgo, nimodipine, and Chinese medicine; non-pharmacological therapies comprising of acupuncture, music therapy, exercise therapy, and nutrition therapy; and a placebo group. The primary outcome was the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score. The secondary outcome was the AD Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog). Results: Twenty-eight trials were eligible, including 6,863 participants. In the direct meta-analysis, as for the Mini-Mental State Examination scale, the ChEIs (MD: -0.38; 95% CI: -0.74, -0.01), Chinese medicine (MD: -0.31; 95% CI: -0.75, 0.13), exercise therapy (MD: -0.50; 95% CI: -0.65, -0.35), music therapy (MD: -1.71; 95% CI: -4.49, 1.07), were statistically more efficient than placebo. For AD Assessment Scalecognitive subscale outcome, ChEIs (MD: 1.20; 95% CI: 0.73, 1.68), Acupuncture (MD: 1.36; 95% CI: 1.28, 1.44), Chinese medicine (MD: 0.61; 95% CI: 0.49, 0.73) and exercise (MD: 0.61; 95% CI: 0.49, 0.73) were better than placebo. In the network meta-analysis, the MMSE outcome ranked music therapy (59%) as the best and Acupuncture (26%) as second. Nutrition and Ginkgo treatment had the lowest rank among all interventions. For ADAS-cog outcome, acupuncture (52) ranked the best. Conclusion: Among the nine treatments studied, music therapy appears to be the best treatment for MCI, followed by acupuncture. Our study provides new insights into potential clinical treatments for MCI due to AD, and may aid the development of guidelines for MCI in AD."

        "Abstract":"Numerous neuropsychological studies have investigated the effect of music on patients with Alzheimer's disease. Findings suggest that music can improve behavioral symptoms, but its potential effects on cognitive abilities of patients still require more investigation. In this 2 × 2 crossover study, we measured the impact of learning an individualized song on autobiographical memory recall and other cognitive abilities in 12 patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. For each patient, one favorite song of the patient and one autobiographical memory with positive valence were associated to create a new personalized song. This song was taught to the patient by a speech and language therapy student throughout 10 sessions. This training period and a non-training period were proposed in a counterbalanced order between participants. We tested participants' autobiographical recall and general cognitive abilities at three time points: at the start of the experiment, at crossover, and at the end of the experiment. After excluding one outlier, results showed a significant improvement in the retrieval of the autobiographical memory and in general cognitive abilities after song training compared to the non-training period. Overall, our findings suggest that the use of personalized songs may be a useful and motivating tool for addressing the decline of autobiographical memory and of cognitive functions in general in persons with Alzheimer's disease."

The present study examined the effect of background music on both positive and negative behaviors, during a time in which patients were not occupied with any structured activity. Twenty eight participants were observed both with and without stimulative, familiar background music. Results showed both a significant increase in positive social behaviors and a significant decrease in negative behaviors related to agitation when music is played. Results demonstrate the contribution of music to enhancing general positive functioning in elderly patients with dementia, and reducing negative behaviors typical of their condition."

Methods: A sample of 25 patients with mild Alzheimer's received therapy based on the application of a music therapy session lasting 60 min. Before and after the therapy, patient saliva was collected to quantify the level of salivary cortisol using the Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay (ELISA) immunoassay technique and a questionnaire was completed to measure anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale). Results: The results show that the application of this therapy lowers the level of stress and decreases significantly depression and anxiety, establishing a linear correlation between the variation of these variables and the variation of cortisol. Conclusions: A short protocol of music therapy can be an alternative medicine to improve emotional variables in Alzheimer patients."

Methods: Ten AD patients (mean age 78.1 years) participated in music therapy using singing training once a week for 6 months (music therapy group). Each session was performed with professional musicians using karaoke and a unique voice training method (the YUBA Method). Before and after the intervention period, each patient was assessed by neuropsychological batteries, and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was performed while the patients sang familiar songs with a karaoke device. As the control group, another 10 AD patients were recruited (mean age 77.0 years), and neuropsychological assessments were performed twice with an interval of 6 months. Results: In the music therapy group, the time for completion of the Japanese Raven's Colored Progressive Matrices was significantly reduced (p = 0.026), and the results obtained from interviewing the patients' caregivers revealed a significant decrease in the Neuropsychiatric Inventory score (p = 0.042) and a prolongation of the patients' sleep time (p = 0.039). The fMRI study revealed increased activity in the right angular gyrus and the left lingual gyrus in the before-minus-after subtraction analysis of the music therapy intervention. Conclusion: Music therapy intervention using singing training may be useful for dementia patients by improving the neural efficacy of cognitive processing."

        "Abstract":"Background: The aim of this study was to systematically assess the effects of exercise rehabilitation program accompanied by experiential music for clinical recovery. Methods: This was a prospective randomized study with 65 stroke survivor patients. All cases underwent a neuropsychological assessment first as a prescreening test, during the admission at the Rehabilitation center (baseline), and 6 months poststroke. All patients received standard treatment for stroke in terms of medical care and rehabilitation. Additionally, all patients were separated into 2 Groups: a music Group (daily listening to experiential\/traditional music), and a control Group (CG) with no experiential\/traditional music therapy (standard care only). Computed tomography perfusion and full neurological examination including GCS were assessment. As Recovery was defined the improvement of cognitive and motor skills of the limb in the affected site, with an increase of muscle strength at least by 1\/5 and with emotional progress. Results: Statistically significant differences were found between the Group CG and the rest of the patients in respect of Lesion size (P = .001) and CBF in affected area (P = .001). Μultivariate analysis revealed that only Group and Lesion size were independent predictors for Recovery (odd ratio [OR][95%confidence interval]) .11(.001-.133) and .798(.668-.954) respectively. Conclusion: The findings of this study suggest that the music-based exercise program has a positive effect on mood profile in stroke patients and Recovery rate is higher when exercise rehabilitation program was accompanied by an enriched sound environment with experiential music."

We assessed whether multimodal interventions based on rhythm-and-music therapy or horse-riding therapy could lead to increased perceived recovery and functional improvement in a mixed population of individuals in late phase after stroke. Methods: Participants were assigned to rhythm-and-music therapy, horse-riding therapy, or control using concealed randomization, stratified with respect to sex and stroke laterality. Therapy was given twice a week for 12 weeks. The primary outcome was change in participants' perception of stroke recovery as assessed by the Stroke Impact Scale with an intention-to-treat analysis. Secondary objective outcome measures were changes in balance, gait, grip strength, and cognition. Blinded assessments were performed at baseline, postintervention, and at 3- and 6-month follow-up. Results: One hundred twenty-three participants were assigned to rhythm-and-music therapy (n=41), horse-riding therapy (n=41), or control (n=41). Post-intervention, the perception of stroke recovery (mean change from baseline on a scale ranging from 1 to 100) was higher among rhythm-and-music therapy (5.2 [95% confidence interval, 0.79-9.61]) and horse-riding therapy participants (9.8 [95% confidence interval, 6.00-13.66]), compared with controls (-0.5 [-3.20 to 2.28]); P=0.001 (1-way ANOVA). The improvements were sustained in both intervention groups 6 months later, and corresponding gains were observed for the secondary outcomes. Conclusions: Multimodal interventions can improve long-term perception of recovery, as well as balance, gait, grip strength, and working memory in a mixed population of individuals in late phase after stroke.

Different approaches and techniques with music are used in the stroke rehabilitation to improve motor and cognitive functions but also psychological outcomes. In this randomized controlled pilot trial, relational active music therapy approaches were tested in the post-acute phase of disease. Thirty-eight hospitalized patients with ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke were recruited and allocated in two groups. The experimental group underwent the standard of care (physiotherapy and occupational therapy daily sessions) and relational active music therapy treatments. The control group underwent the standard of care only. Motor functions and psychological aspects were assessed before and after treatments. Music therapy process was also evaluated using a specific rating scale. All groups showed a positive trend in quality of life, functional and disability levels, and gross mobility. The experimental group showed a decrease of anxiety and, in particular, of depression (p = 0.016). In addition, the strength of non-dominant hand (grip) significantly increased in the experimental group (p = 0.041). Music therapy assessment showed a significant improvement over time of non-verbal and sonorous-music relationships. Future studies, including a greater number of patients and follow-up evaluations, are needed to confirm promising results of this study."

        "Abstract":"Objective: Music-supported therapy (MST) is a new approach for motor rehabilitation of stroke patients. Recently, many studies have demonstrated that MST improved the motor functions of post-stroke patients. However, the underlying mechanism for this effect is still unclear. It may result from repeated practice or repeated practice combined with musical stimulation. Currently, few studies have been designed to clarify this discrepancy. In this study, the application of \"mute\" musical instruments allowed for the study of music as an independent factor. Methods: Thirty-three post-stroke patients with no substantial previous musical training were included. Participants were assigned to either audible music group (MG) or mute music group (CG), permitting observation of music's independent effect. All subjects received the conventional rehabilitation treatments. Patients in MG (n = 15) received 20 extra sessions of audible musical instrument training over 4 weeks. Patients in CG (n = 18) received \"mute\" musical instrument training of the same protocol as that of MG. Wolf motor function test (WMFT) and Fugl-Meyer assessment (FMA) for upper limbs were utilised to evaluate motor functions of patients in both groups before and after the treatment. Three patients in CG dropped out. Results: All participants in both groups showed significant improvements in motor functions of upper limbs after 4 weeks' treatment. However, significant differences in the WMFT were found between the two groups (WMFT-quality: P = 0.025; WMFT-time: P = 0.037), but not in the FMA (P = 0.448). In short, all participants showed significant improvement after 4 weeks' treatment, but subjects in MG demonstrated greater improvement than those in CG. Discussion: This study supports that MST, when combined with conventional treatment, is effective for the recovery of motor skills in post-stroke patients. Additionally, it suggests that apart from the repetitive practices of MST, music may play a unique role in improving upper-limb motor function for post-stroke patients."

        "Abstract":"The use of functional music in gait training termed rhythmic auditory stimulation (RAS) and treadmill training (TT) have both been shown to be effective in stroke patients (SP). The combination of RAS and treadmill training (RAS-TT) has not been clinically evaluated to date. The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of RAS-TT on functional gait in SP. The protocol followed the design of an explorative study with a rater-blinded three arm prospective randomized controlled parallel group design. Forty-five independently walking SP with a hemiparesis of the lower limb or an unsafe and asymmetrical walking pattern were recruited. RAS-TT was carried out over 4 weeks with TT and neurodevelopmental treatment based on Bobath approach (NDT) serving as control interventions. For RAS-TT functional music was adjusted individually while walking on the treadmill. Pre and post-assessments consisted of the fast gait speed test (FGS), a gait analysis with the locometre (LOC), 3 min walking time test (3MWT), and an instrumental evaluation of balance (IEB). Raters were blinded to group assignments. An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was performed with affiliated measures from pre-assessment and time between stroke and start of study as covariates. Thirty-five participants (mean age 63.6 ± 8.6 years, mean time between stroke and start of study 42.1 ± 23.7 days) completed the study (11 RAS-TT, 13 TT, 11 NDT). Significant group differences occurred in the FGS for adjusted post-measures in gait velocity [F (2, 34) = 3.864, p = 0.032; partial η2 = 0.205] and cadence [F (2, 34) = 7.656, p = 0.002; partial η2 = 0.338]. Group contrasts showed significantly higher values for RAS-TT. Stride length results did not vary between the groups. LOC, 3MWT, and IEB did not indicate group differences. One patient was withdrawn from TT because of pain in one arm. The study provides first evidence for a higher efficacy of RAS-TT in comparison to the standard approaches TT and NDT in restoring functional gait in SP. The results support the implementation of functional music in neurological gait rehabilitation and its use in combination with treadmill training.

Seventeen participants with moderate hand impairment in the chronic phase of stroke were randomized to 3 wk of home-based exercise with either the MusicGlove or conventional tabletop exercises. The primary outcome measure was the change in the Box and Blocks test score from baseline to 1 mo posttreatment. Both groups significantly improved their Box and Blocks test score, but no significant difference was found between groups. The MusicGlove group did exhibit significantly greater improvements than the conventional exercise group in motor activity log quality of movement and amount of use scores 1 mo posttherapy (p = 0.007 and p = 0.04, respectively). Participants significantly increased their use of MusicGlove over time, completing 466 gripping movements per day on average at study end. MusicGlove therapy was not superior to conventional tabletop exercises for the primary end point but was nevertheless feasible and led to a significantly greater increase in self-reported functional use and quality of movement of the impaired hand than conventional home exercises.

They received NMT and SLT for 1 month. Language function was assessed by Korean version-Western Aphasia Battery before and after therapy. NMT consisted of therapeutic singing and melodic intonation therapy, and SLT consisted of language-oriented therapy. Results: Significant improvements were revealed in AQ, repetition, and naming after therapy in the NMT group and improvements in repetition in the SLT group of chronic stroke patients (p<0.05). There were significant improvements in language ability in the NMT group of subacute stroke patients. However, there was no significant improvement in the SLT group of subacute stroke patients. Conclusion: We concluded that the two therapies are effective treatments in the chronic stage of stroke and NMT is effective in subacute post-stroke aphasic patients."

Materials and methods: The experimental group (n = 10) was randomized to 30 MT individual sessions over 15 weeks in addition to 30 SLT individual sessions while the control group (n = 10) was randomized to only 30 SLT sessions during the same period. Psychological and speech language assessment were made before (T0) and after (T1) the treatments. Results: The study shows a significant improvement in spontaneous speech in the experimental group (Aachener Aphasie subtest: p = 0.020; Cohen's d = 0.35); the 50% of the experimental group showed also an improvement in vitality scores of Short Form Health Survey (chi-square test = 4.114; p = 0.043). Conclusions: The current trial highlights the possibility that the combined use of MT and SLT can lead to a better result in the rehabilitation of patients with aphasia than SLT alone."

        "Abstract":"Objective: Rhythmic auditory stimulation (RAS) belongs to neurologic music therapy, which has attracted clinical attention because of its efficacy in motor function after stroke. This study aimed to summarize the effectiveness of rhythmic auditory stimulation (RAS) for the treatment of motor function and balance ability in stroke through a systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods: All studies were retrieved from six databases. The effects of RAS on stroke were determined using the following indicators: motor function including step length, step cadence, velocity, Fugl-Meyer assessment (FMA); and balance ability including overall balance index (OBI) and Berg Balance Scale (BBS). The risk map of bias of the quality of the studies and the meta-analysis results of the indicators was prepared using RevMan 5.2 software. Results: A total of 1,363 abstracts were retrieved. Among them, 325 duplicate studies were eliminated, and 971 studies were excluded after reading the titles and abstracts. In addition, by downloading the full text for further reading and screening, 47 studies were excluded. A total of 22 studies were included in the systematic review, and 18 studies were included in the meta-analysis. Assessment of quality, based on the PEDro scale, two studies had low quality, three studies had excellent quality, and the other studies had good quality; based on the Cochrane Collaborative Network Bias Risk Assessment Scale. A total of 15 studies specifically explained the random methods used. Meanwhile, seven studies did not report random sequence generation. A total of 10 studies reported that the evaluation of experimental results was blinded. In the meta-analysis, the results of motor function [namely, velocity (SMD = 0.99, 95% CI (0.43, 1.55)), step length (SMD = 0.97, 95% CI (0.74, 1.20)), and step cadence (MD = 5.16, 95% CI (4.17, 6.14)), FMA (MD = 2.93, 95% CI (2.04, 3.83))], were statistically significant (P < 0.01). The results of balance ability [OBI (MD = -0.51, 95% CI (-0.86, -0.16)) and BBS (MD = 2.93, 95% CI (1.67, 4.20))], were also statistically significant (P < 0.01). Among all the outcome indicators, three indicators were included in more than 10 studies: these are step length, step cadence, and velocity. The results showed that the two sides of the funnel chart were asymmetrical, thus these results all showed heterogeneity. The GRADEpro GDT online tool was used to evaluate the quality of evidence for the outcome indicators in the included studies. Five outcome indicators were included, of which three were low-quality indicators and two were moderate-quality indicators. Conclusions: RAS could improve gait parameters, walking function, and balance ability of individuals with stroke. However, studies or samples of outcome indicators for balance ability of stroke patients is relatively insufficient, which also requires further research in the future.

        "Abstract":"Background: Given the increasing evidence demonstrating the effects of rhythmic auditory cueing for motor rehabilitation of stroke patients, this synthesized analysis is needed in order to improve rehabilitative practice and maximize clinical effectiveness. Objective: This study aimed to systematically analyze the literature on rhythmic auditory cueing for motor rehabilitation of stroke patients by highlighting the outcome variables, type of cueing, and stage of stroke. Methods: A systematic review with meta-analysis of randomized controlled or clinically controlled trials was conducted. Electronic databases and music therapy journals were searched for studies including stroke, the use of rhythmic auditory cueing, and motor outcomes, such as gait and upper-extremity function. Results: A total of 10 studies (RCT or CCT) with 356 individuals were included for meta-analysis. There were large effect sizes (Hedges's g = 0.984 for walking velocity; Hedges's g = 0.840 for cadence; Hedges's g = 0.760 for stride length; and Hedges's g = 0.456 for Fugl-Meyer test scores) in the use of rhythmic auditory cueing. Additional subgroup analysis demonstrated that although the type of rhythmic cueing and stage of stroke did not lead to statistically substantial group differences, the effect sizes and heterogeneity values in each subgroup implied possible differences in treatment effect. Conclusions: This study corroborates the beneficial effects of rhythmic auditory cueing, supporting its expanded application to broadened areas of rehabilitation for stroke patients. Also, it suggests the future investigation of the differential outcomes depending on how rhythmic auditory cueing is provided in terms of type and intensity implemented."

        "Abstract":"Objectives: Five-element music constitutes a complementary therapy in stroke and other acquired brain injuries. Aphasia represents a great problem faced by individuals with stroke. Five-element music, a new type of therapy, may benefit people with poststroke aphasia (PSA). The present study summarized evidences describing the effects of five-element music in language treatment in patients with PSA. Methods: A total of 20 databases and websites were searched from inception to May 2018, including published or unpublished gray literature. Both randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials were included in the literature review. Two reviewers independently screened and assessed relevant publications; data extraction was carried out with specific forms. The above reviewers also assessed the quality of each trial by using the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. After evaluating heterogeneity among studies, quantitative synthesis was applied, where appropriate. Review Manager (Rev Man) 5.3 was employed to examine the pooled effect of five-element music for PSA compared with control therapy. Results: Six RCTs met the eligibility criteria and included 516 patients and were assessed by meta-analysis and quality analysis. Five-element music more significantly increased language scores than Western music therapy or routine care controls in repetition (standardized mean difference [SMD] = 1.96; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.55-3.37), spontaneous speech (SMD = 1.29; 95% CI 0.53-2.04), and naming (SMD = 1.11; 95% CI 0.80-1.43) (all p < 0.05). No adverse events were reported. Conclusions: Five-element music might moderately improve language rehabilitation in individuals with PSA; however, higher quality RCTs with consistent interventions are required to confirm these findings."

Methods: We searched studies that explored the effect of music therapy on language function in post-stroke aphasia and published in PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, CINAHL, ProQuest Digital Dissertations, and ClinicalTrials.gov from inception to March 2021. Six reviewers independently screened out eligible studies, extracted data, and evaluated the methodological quality. Results were pooled using mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Heterogeneity was assessed by the chi-square test and I2 statistic. Results: Six studies were included in this meta-analysis involving 115 patients. The methodological quality of these studies ranged from poor to excellent. There was significant mean difference in functional communication for post-stroke aphasia by 1.45 (95% CI: 0.24, 2.65; P = 0.02, from poor to excellent evidence), in repetition by 6.49 (95% CI: 0.97, 12.00; P = 0.02, from acceptable to excellent evidence), and in naming by 11.44 (95% CI: 1.63, 21.26; P = 0.02, from acceptable to excellent evidence). But there was no significant difference in comprehension for post-stroke aphasia by 7.21 (95% CI: - 10.88, 25.29; P = 0.43, from acceptable to excellent evidence). Conclusions: Music therapy can improve functional communication, repetition, and naming in patients with post-stroke aphasia, but did not significantly improve comprehension.

        "Abstract":"Background: The clinical application of music therapy and research into its use and effectiveness are common in Western countries. The physiological role of this type of therapy is to stimulate the central nervous system through music, which may have a sedative, analgesic effect, and reduce negative emotions. Previous studies have confirmed that music can be effective for a range of psychological disorders, including post-stroke depression (PSD). There is, however, a lack of systematic evaluation of its effectiveness, and variability in sample size and in the quality of research has detracted from the persuasiveness of findings. Methods: Based on PRISMA 2020, articles on music therapy intervention in post-stroke depression were identified through the Web of Science, PubMed, EMBASE, CNKI, Weipu, and Wanfang databases. The retrieval time was taken from the establishment of the database to October 18, 2022. Two researchers conducted a stringent evaluation of the quality of the articles and extracted the data. They then used RevMan5.3 software for meta-analysis. Results: Twenty articles were listed, involving 1625 patients. Meta-analysis results showed that music therapy could lower scores on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS\/Ham-D), the National Institutes of Health stroke scale and self-rated depression scale for patients with PSD. Music therapy was also shown to improve the Barthel Index for Activities of Daily Living and treatment efficacy of PSD patients. However, music therapy did not reduce the incidence of adverse reactions in PSD patients. Conclusion: Music therapy has benefits in improving HDRS\/Ham-D score and symptoms of PSD patients, and could be more widely applied."

        "Abstract":"Unilateral visuo-spatial neglect is a neuropsychological syndrome commonly resulting from right hemisphere stroke at the temporo-parietal junction of the infero-posterior parietal cortex. Neglect is characterized by reduced awareness of stimuli presented on patients' contralesional side of space. Inspired by evidence of increased spatial exploration of patients' left side achieved during keyboard scale-playing, the current study employed a music intervention that involved making sequential goal-directed actions in the neglected part of space, in order to determine whether this would bring about clinically significant improvement in chronic neglect. Two left neglect patients completed an intervention comprising four weekly 30-min music intervention sessions involving playing scales and familiar melodies on chime bars from right to left. Two cancellation tests [Mesulam shape, Behavioral Inattention Test (BIT) star], the neglect subtest from the computerized TAP (Test of Attentional Performance) battery, and the line bisection test were administered three times during a preliminary baseline phase, before and after the four intervention sessions during the intervention phase to investigate short-term effects, and 1 week after the last intervention session to investigate whether any changes in performance would persist. Both patients demonstrated significant short-term and longer-lasting improvements on the Mesulam shape cancellation test. One patient also showed longer-lasting effects on the BIT star cancellation test and scored in the normal range 1 week after the intervention. These findings provide preliminary evidence that active music-making with a horizontally aligned instrument may help neglect patients attend more to their affected side."

Methods: Eligible, post-stroke, hemiplegic patients were prospectively enrolled in this study. The inclusion criteria were a diagnosis of hemiplegia due to stroke, and ability to walk more than 10 m with or without gait aids. Each patient underwent structured music therapy sessions comprising 7 consecutive tasks, and were trained to sing in their mind (mental singing) while walking. Before, and after training sessions, gait ability was assessed using the 10-Meter Walk Test (10MWT), the Timed Up and Go test (TUG), gait velocity, cadence and stride length. Results: Twenty patients were enrolled in the interventions. Following the mental singing while walking intervention, significant improvement was observed in the 10MWT (13.16±7.61 to 12.27±7.58; p=0.002) and the TUG test (19.36±15.37 to 18.42±16.43; p=0.006). Significant improvement was also seen in gait cadence (90.36±29.11 to 95.36±30.2; p<0.001), stride length (90.99±33.4 to 98.17±35.33; p<0.001) and velocity (0.66±0.45 to 0.71±0.47; p<0.002). Conclusion: These results indicate the possible effects of mental singing while walking on gait in patients diagnosed with hemiplegic stroke."

        "Abstract":"Gross motor impairments are common after stroke, but efficient and motivating therapies for these impairments are scarce. We present an innovative musical sonification therapy, especially designed to retrain patients' gross motor functions. Sonification should motivate patients and provide additional sensory input informing about relative limb position. Twenty-five stroke patients were included in a clinical pre-post study and took part in the sonification training. The patients' upper extremity functions, their psychological states, and their arm movement smoothness were assessed pre and post training. Patients were randomly assigned to either of two groups. Both groups received an average of 10 days (M = 9.88; SD = 2.03; 30 min\/day) of musical sonification therapy [music group (MG)] or a sham sonification movement training [control group (CG)], respectively. The only difference between the two protocols was that in the CG no sound was played back during training. In the beginning, patients explored the acoustic effects of their arm movements in space. At the end of the training, the patients played simple melodies by coordinated arm movements. The 15 patients in the MG showed significantly reduced joint pain (F = 19.96, p < 0.001) in the Fugl-Meyer assessment after training. They also reported a trend to have improved hand function in the stroke impact scale as compared to the CG. Movement smoothness at day 1, day 5, and the last day of the intervention was compared in MG patients and found to be significantly better after the therapy. Taken together, musical sonification may be a promising therapy for motor impairments after stroke, but further research is required since estimated effect sizes point to moderate treatment outcomes."

        "Abstract":"Background: Music-supported therapy has been shown to be an effective tool for rehabilitation of motor deficits after stroke. A unique feature of music performance is that it is inherently social: music can be played together in synchrony. Aim: The present study explored the potential of synchronized music playing during therapy, asking whether synchronized playing could improve fine motor rehabilitation and mood. Method: Twenty-eight patients in neurological early rehabilitation after stroke with no substantial previous musical training were included. Patients learned to play simple finger exercises and familiar children's songs on the piano for 10 sessions of half an hour. Patients first received three individual therapy sessions and then continued in pairs. The patient pairs were divided into two groups. Patients in one group played synchronously (together group) whereas the patients in the other group played one after the other (in-turn group). To assess fine motor skill recovery the patients performed standard clinical tests such as the nine-hole-pegboard test (9HPT) and index finger-tapping speed and regularity, and metronome-paced finger tapping. Patients' mood was established using the Profile of Mood States (POMS). Results: Both groups showed improvements in fine motor control. In metronome-paced finger tapping, patients in both groups improved significantly. Mood tests revealed reductions in depression and fatigue in both groups. During therapy, patients in the in-turn group rated their partner as more sympathetic than the together-group in a visual-analog scale. Conclusions: Our results suggest that music-supported stroke rehabilitation can improve fine motor control and mood not only individually but also in patient pairs. Patients who were playing in turn rather than simultaneously tended to reveal greater improvement in fine motor skill. We speculate that patients in the former group may benefit from the opportunity to learn from observation."

        "Abstract":"Music has been proven to have therapeutic potential in neurological disorders, especially Parkinson's disease (PD), since rhythmic auditory cueing can partially replace the progressive loss of rhythmicity and automaticity. Several reports have highlighted improvements in motor outcomes in PD patients undergoing music therapy, but only a few studies have evaluated non-motor outcomes, such as quality of life (QoL), which deteriorates with disease progression. The current pilot study aims to examine the effects of a multimodal rehabilitation program centered on physical therapy combined with listening to music on self-reported QoL in people with PD, compared to the same rehabilitation program alone. The study was conducted on patients with idiopathic PD who attended a specific rehabilitation program with a duration of 2.5 h daily for 14 days. The patients were divided into the study group (16 patients), who listened to background music during the rehabilitation program sessions, and the control group who did not listen to music during sessions. The patients were assessed using the self-report Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39) at the beginning of the program and 1 month after its initiation. The patients in the study group registered greater improvements in five of the eight areas of life assessed by PDQ-39 compared to the control group. In conclusion, listening to music combined with a multimodal rehabilitation program centered on physical therapy may be beneficial for the patients' quality of life."

        "Abstract":"Objective: Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) frequently experience depression associated with voice problems. Singing involves the use of similar muscles and the neural networks associated with vocal function and emotional response. The purpose of this study is to enhance vocal quality and depressive symptoms of patients with PD using individual singing program. Methods: The Individual Therapeutic Singing Program for PD (ITSP-PD) was conducted by a certified music therapist. In total, nine PD patients with a subjective voice problem or depression participated in 6 sessions over 2 weeks. We measured the Maximum Phonation Time (MPT) via the Praat test, the Voice Handicap Index (VHI), the Voice-Related Quality of Life (V-RQOL) and the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). Results: In total, 8 out of 9 patients completed all the sessions; 6 out of 8 patients participated in the follow-up test after 6 months. A statistically significant change in MPT (p = 0.011) was observed between the pre- and post-tests. The VHI (p = 0.035) and the GDS (p = 0.018) were significantly lower in the post-test. In the pre-, post-, and follow-up tests, the MPT (p = 0.030), V-RQOL (p = 0.008), and GDS (p = 0.009) were significantly changed. Conclusion: The ITSP-PD based on neurological singing therapy for PD showed therapeutic possibility for vocal function and depression in patients with PD. Our findings suggest the need for a randomized study to examine the continuing positive effects of the ITSP-PD over a longer period of time."

        "Abstract":"Background: Modern management of Parkinson's disease (PD) aims to obtain symptom control, to reduce clinical disability, and to improve quality of life. Music acts as a specific stimulus to obtain motor and emotional responses by combining movement and stimulation of different sensory pathways. We explored the efficacy of active music therapy (MT) on motor and emotional functions in patients with PD. Methods: This prospective, randomized, controlled, single-blinded study lasted 3 months. It consisted of weekly sessions of MT and physical therapy (PT). Thirty-two patients with PD, all stable responders to levodopa and in Hoehn and Yahr stage 2 or 3, were randomly assigned to two groups of 16 patients each. We assessed severity of PD with the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, emotional functions with the Happiness Measure, and quality of life using the Parkinson's Disease Quality of Life Questionnaire. MT sessions consisted of choral singing, voice exercise, rhythmic and free body movements, and active music involving collective invention. PT sessions included a series of passive stretching exercises, specific motor tasks, and strategies to improve balance and gait. Results: MT had a significant overall effect on bradykinesia as measured by the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (p < .034). Post-MT session findings were consistent with motor improvement, especially in bradykinesia items (p < .0001). Over time, changes on the Happiness Measure confirmed a beneficial effect of MT on emotional functions (p < .0001). Improvements in activities of daily living and in quality of life were also documented in the MT group (p < .0001). PT improved rigidity (p < .0001). Conclusions: MT is effective on motor, affective, and behavioral functions. We propose active MT as a new method for inclusion in PD rehabilitation programs."

Singing shares many of the neural networks and structural mechanisms used during speech and, thus, has potential for therapeutic application to address speech disorders. Objective. To explore the effects of an interdisciplinary singing-based therapeutic intervention (ParkinSong) on voice and communication in people with PD. Methods. A controlled trial compared the effects of the ParkinSong intervention with an active control condition at 2 dosage levels (weekly vs monthly) over 3 months, on voice, speech, respiratory strength, and voice-related quality-of-life outcomes for 75 people living with PD. The interdisciplinary ParkinSong model comprised high-effort vocal and respiratory tasks, speech exercises, group singing, and social communication opportunities. Results. ParkinSong intervention participants demonstrated significant improvements in vocal intensity (P = .018), maximum expiratory pressure (P = .032), and voice-related quality of life (P = .043) in comparison to controls. Weekly ParkinSong participants increased vocal intensity more than monthly participants (P = .011). Vocal intensity declined in nontreatment control groups. No statistical differences between groups on maximum phonation length or maximum inspiratory pressure were observed at 3 months. Conclusions. ParkinSong is an engaging intervention with the potential to increase loudness and respiratory function in people with mild to moderately severe PD."

        "Abstract":"This systematic review and meta-analysis examined previous studies on music-based interventions for individuals with Parkinson’s disease (PD). The effectiveness of the interventions on various motor and non-motor outcomes was evaluated. This review was conducted by searching PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and Cochrane Library CENTRAL prior to June 2022 for randomized controlled trial (RCT) and controlled clinical trial (CCT) studies published in English. Data were expressed as weighted\/standardized mean difference (MD\/SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). I2 index was used for heterogeneity. The initial search identified 745 studies, and 13 studies involving 417 participants with PD which met the inclusion criteria included in this review. The results of the meta-analysis revealed that music-based interventions can significantly improve walking velocity (MD = 0.12, 95% CI = 0.07~0.16, p < 0.00001), stride length (MD = 0.04, 95% CI = 0.02~0.07, p = 0.002), and mobility (MD = −1.05, 95% CI = −1.53~−0.57, p < 0.0001). However, the results did not support significant effects for music-based interventions on cadence (MD = 3.21, 95% CI = −4.15~10.57, p = 0.39), cognitive flexibility (MD = 20.91, 95% CI = −10.62~52.44, p = 0.19), inhibition (SMD = 0.07, 95% CI = −0.40~0.55, p = 0.76), and quality of life (SMD = −0.68, 95% CI= −1.68~0.32, p = 0.18). The findings suggest that music-based interventions are effective for the improvement of some motor symptoms, but evidence for non-motor symptoms is limited. Further high-quality studies with a larger sample size are required to obtain the robust effects of music-based interventions on various outcomes among patients with PD."

        "Abstract":"Idiopathic Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a progressive condition with gait disturbance and balance disorder as the main symptoms. Previous research studies focused on the application of Rhythmic Auditory Stimulation (RAS) in PD gait rehabilitation. The key hypothesis of this pilot study, however, assumes the major role of the combination of all three Neurologic Music Therapy (NMT) sensorimotor techniques in improving spatio-temporal gait parameters, and postural stability in the course of PD. The 55 PD-diagnosed subjects invited to the study were divided into two groups: 30 in the experimental and 25 in the control group. Inclusion criteria included Hoehn and Yahr stages 2 or 3, the ability to walk independently without any aid and stable pharmacological treatment for the duration of the experiment. In order to evaluate the efficacy of the chosen therapy procedure the following measures were applied: Optoelectrical 3D Movement Analysis, System BTS Smart for gait, and Computerized Dynamic Posturography CQ Stab for stability and balance. All measures were conducted both before and after the therapy cycle. The subjects from the experimental group attended music therapy sessions four times a week for 4 weeks. Therapeutic Instrumental Music Performance (TIMP), Pattern Sensory Enhancement (PSE) and RAS were used in every 45-min session for practicing daily life activities, balance, pre-gait, and gait pattern. Percussion instruments, the metronome and rhythmic music were the basis for each session. The subjects from the control group were asked to stay active and perform daily life activities between the measures. The research showed that the combination of the three NMT sensorimotor techniques can be used to improve gait and other rhythmical activities in PD rehabilitation. The results demonstrated significant improvement in the majority of the spatiotemporal gait parameters in the experimental group in comparison to the control group. In the stability tests with eyes closed, substantial differences were revealed, indicating improvement of proprioception (the sense of body position and movement). These findings suggest a new compensatory strategy for movement and postural control through the use of the auditory system."

Four female patients, who demonstrated voice and speech problems, served as their own controls and participated in baseline assessment (study pretest), a series of MTVP sessions involving vocal and singing exercises, and final evaluation (study posttest). In study pre and posttests, data for speech intelligibility and all acoustic variables were collected. Statistically significant increases were found in speech intelligibility, as rated by caregivers, and in vocal intensity from study pretest to posttest as the results of paired samples t-tests. In addition, before and after each MTVP session (session pre and posttests), self-rated mood scores and selected acoustic variables were collected. No significant differences were found in any of the variables from the session pretests to posttests, across the entire treatment period, or their interactions as the results of two-way ANOVAs with repeated measures. Although not significant, the mean of mood scores in session posttests (M = 8.69) was higher than that in session pretests (M = 7.93)."

        "Abstract":"Purpose Interventions focused on singing may provide additional benefits to established voice and respiratory therapies, due to their greater emphasis on the respiratory muscle control system in those with Parkinson's disease (PD) progresses. The purpose of this study was to examine if singing can improve voice, respiratory pressure and quality of life (QOL) in persons with PD. Methods This pilot study measured the effects of a singing intervention in 27 participants with PD. Participants were assigned to a high (met twice weekly) or low (met once weekly) dosage group. Voice, respiratory and QOL measures were recorded before and after an 8-week singing intervention. Sessions were led by board-certified music therapists and included a series of vocal and articulation exercises and group singing. Results Both groups demonstrated significant improvements in maximum inspiratory and expiratory pressure, as well as phonation time. While other voice measures improved, they did not reach statistical significance. Voice QOL and whole health QOL also significantly improved. Conclusion These results suggest singing may be a beneficial and engaging treatment choice for improving and maintaining vocal function and respiratory pressure in persons with PD. Implications for Rehabilitation In a small sample, group singing proved beneficial for improving voice and respiratory impairment in persons with Parkinson's disease. Completing group singing one time per week for 8 weeks was as effective as completing group singing two times per week for 8 weeks in persons with Parkinson's disease. Group singing is an effective means of improving overall quality of life in persons with Parkinson's disease."

This study examined the usefulness of using a portable gait rhythmogram (PGR) in music therapy on PD-related gait disturbance. A total of 19 subjects with PD who exhibited gait disturbance were evaluated for gait speed and step length during a 10 m straight walking task. Moreover, acceleration, cadence, and trajectory of the center of the body were estimated using a PGR. Walking tasks were created while incorporating music intervention that gradually increased in tempo from 90 to 120 beats per minute (BPM). We then evaluated whether immediate improvement in gait could be recognized even without music after walking tasks by comparing pre- (pre-MT) and post-music therapy (post-MT) values. Post-MT gait showed significant improvement in acceleration, gait speed, cadence, and step length. During transitions throughout the walking tasks, acceleration, gait speed, cadence, and step length gradually increased in tasks with music. With regard to the trajectory of the center of the body, we recognized a reduction in post-MT medio-lateral amplitude. Music therapy immediately improved gait disturbance in patients with PD, and the effectiveness was objectively shown using PGR."

        "Abstract":"Background: The existing methodological weakness in conducted researches concerning music therapy (MT) for children with autism led to ambiguity and confusion in this scope of studies. The aim of the present research is to identify the effectiveness of MT method in improving social skills of children with autism and its stability, as well. Materials and methods: In the form of a clinical trial study with design of pretest\/posttest\/follow-up with control group, among the children with autism in community of Tehran city, on the basis of childhood autism rating scale, 27 children with mild to moderate autism were chosen and were divided into two groups of experiment (n = 13), and control (n = 14). Social skills' level of both groups was measured and recorded with the help of social skills rating system scale. The children of the experiment group participated in MT programs of Orff-Schulwerk for 45 days in 12 sessions (two sessions of 1-h\/week), whereas the control group received no intervention. The data were analyzed with Statistic Package For Social Science (SPSS) software t-test and analysis of covariance was used to compare groups. Results: In posttest, the results of covariance analysis showed a significant increase in social skills' scores of the experiment group (P < 0.001). Also, results of the paired-sample t-test showed that the effectiveness of MT has been persistent up to the follow-up phase. Conclusions: The study showed that MT is an effective method with deep and consistent effects on improving social skills of children with autism."

        "Abstract":"Objectives: This study was to investigated the efficacy of music therapy (MT) in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) via a meta-analysis that comprehensively evaluated data from all eligible research in this field. Design: Systematic review and meta-analysis. Setting: A systematic search of the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases from inception to October 2021 to identify studies that administered MT to children with ASD. Results: Eight randomized controlled trials (RCTs) including 608 participants met the inclusion criteria. The meta-analysis showed that MT was associated with a significant increase in social reactions among children with ASD (standardized mean difference (SMD) = 0.24, 95% confidence interval (CI) [0.03, 0.46], I 2 = 0%, P = 0.03). However, MT did not elicit a significant increase in symptom severity (SMD = 0.17, 95% CI [-0.04,0.38], I 2 = 0%,P = 0.12), social adaptive behavior (SMD = 0.02, 95% CI [-0.44,0.48], I 2 = 0%,P = 0.93) or speech (SMD = 0.04, 95% CI [-0.39, 0.47], I 2 = 0%, P = 0.86) in children with ASD. Conclusion: MT can improve social skills in children with ASD; however, there does not seem to be a consensus on the persistence of its effects. These findings can inform clinical practice. Promoting the use of MT in children with ASD and improving its symptoms are the ultimate goals."

The Autism-Competence-Group (AutCom) combines a psycho-educative approach with music and dance\/movement interventions in adults with ASD and ID. AutCom includes 16 structured 90-minute sessions to foster social and emotional competencies. This study investigates the acceptability and effectiveness of AutCom. Practicability and acceptability were measured based on participation frequency and patient satisfaction (CSQ-8). Efficacy was assessed in a pre-post design (N = 12) based on self- and third-party assessment with a control group matched by gender and level of ID. Primary outcome variables were social and emotional competence, and secondary outcomes were challenging behavior and quality of life. A participation rate of 86% indicated practicability; high CSQ-8 scores (M = 30 of max. 32) indicated acceptability. Significant improvement was found in social competence compared to the control group and emotional competence in the pre-post self-assessment on the AutCom questionnaire. No significant improvement was found in challenging behavior and quality of life. AutCom is shown to be a promising and highly accepted group concept in fostering social and emotional skills in adults with ASD and ID."

It was a randomized controlled study employing a single subject comparison design in two different conditions, improvisational music therapy and play sessions with toys, and using standardized tools and DVD analysis of sessions to evaluate behavioral changes in children with autism. The overall results indicated that improvisational music therapy was more effective at facilitating joint attention behaviors and non-verbal social communication skills in children than play. Session analysis showed significantly more and lengthier events of eye contact and turn-taking in improvisational music therapy than play sessions.

        "Abstract":"Aim: To evaluate the efficacy of Neurologic Music Therapy (NMT) using a traditional and a technological intervention (elastic touch-display) in improving the coordination of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), as a primary outcome, and the timing and strength control of their movements as secondary outcomes. Methods: Twenty-two children with ASD completed 8 NMT sessions, as a part of a 2-month intervention. Participants were randomly assigned to either use an elastic touch-display (experimental group) or tambourines (control group). We conducted pre- and post- assessment evaluations, including the Developmental Coordination Disorder Questionnaire (DCDQ) and motor assessments related to the control of strength and timing of movements. Outcomes and results: All participants improved their coordination, according to the DCDQ scores, and exhibited better control of their movements according to the strength and timing assessments after the intervention. Participants who used the elastic touch-display scored higher on the DCDQ. Conclusions and implications: NMT is an efficacious treatment to improve the coordination skills of children with ASD. Elastic touch-displays provide more benefits than the use of tambourines."

        "Abstract":"Background: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterised by significant impairment in social communication and the presence of restrictive and repetitive behaviour or interest. Intervention during early childhood could decrease ASD symptoms. We aimed to identify the most effective intervention based on cognitive, developmental, and behavioural approaches and the factors that impact the effectiveness of the intervention. Methods: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of existing interventions for ASD in preschool-aged children. Electronic databases were searched for related articles with randomised controlled trial (RCT) designs published between 2001 to 2015. Outcome measures were communication, behavioural and cognitive skills, reported as standardised mean differences (SMD) compared to a control group. A Random-effects model was utilised to calculate the pooled estimate effect. Between-study variability was also assessed. The registering number of this study is CRD42017035354. Findings: Out of the initial 5174 studies that were identified, there were 14 RCTs (746 children) that were included in the final systematic review and meta-analysis. Pooled estimate effect provided by random-effects model was 0.23 (95% confidence interval, CI [0.08-0.37]) with no between-study heterogeneity (I2 = 0.00%, p = 0.0018). Three studies of music therapy interventions provided the greatest outcome effects with a shorter duration and lower intensity. SMD for music therapies ranged from 0.40 to 0.62 with 95% CI [0.22 to 1.85]. The quality of the health care provider, the duration, and the intensity of intervention played an important role in the effectiveness of the intervention. Interpretation: Music therapy appears to be an effective tool for improving social interaction in preschool-aged children with ASD. However, more evidence-based trials are required to further validate the effectiveness of music therapy in ASD."

This study used a combined single-subject research design consisting of delayed multiple baseline across the participants and a multielement design to compare the effects of each music intervention technique targeting the child's verbal response during playback of a practiced song. Findings demonstrated \"singing\" to be associated with the lowest latency compared to the other two interventions (\"listening\" and \"singing and music\") across participants. Additionally, happiness levels varied from neutral to happy, signifying an overall positive experience during participation in the music applied behavior analysis (ABA) intervention."

        "Abstract":"Objective: To systematically evaluate the effectiveness of five-element music therapy on anxiety, depression, quality of life (QoL), sleep quality and Karnofsky performance score (KPS) in cancer patients. Methods: We searched English databases (PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, Web of Science) and Chinese databases (CNKI, WanFang, CBM and VIP database) from the inception to December 25, 2020. Two investigators independently screened literature, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias according to the eligibility criteria. The RevMan 5.3 software was used to perform the meta-analysis. Results: A total of 22 studies, 2053 people with cancer were included. Meta-analysis showed that five-element music therapy had a significant difference for relieving depression (SMD = -1.11, 95% CI: 1.41 to -0.82, P < 0.00001), QoL (SMD = 1.41, 95% CI:0.58 to 2.23, P = 0.0008), sleep quality (MD = -1.73, 95% CI: 2.34 to -1.12, P < 0.00001), and KPS (MD = 4.75, 95% CI:2.31 to 7.18, P = 0.0001). And five-element music therapy did not show a positive effect on anxiety (SMD = -0.60, 95% CI: 1.47 to 0.27, P = 0.17). Conclusions: Five-element music therapy had a positive effect on depression, QoL, sleep quality, and KPS in cancer patients, while did not show a positive effect on anxiety. Future researchers need to optimize the research program and conduct more high-quality, large sample, multi-center randomized controlled studies. Besides, it would be helpful for future researchers to explain the five-element music therapy being examined and how it is potentially useful in western contexts."

The outcomes were overall quality of life, anxiety, depression and pain. Results: A total of 19 trials evaluating 1,548 patients were included in this study, of which 765 were in the control group and 783 in the experimental group. Compared with standard care, music therapy can significantly increase the score of the overall quality of life in patients with cancer. In addition, music therapy was found to be more effective for decreasing the score of anxiety, depression and pain. Conclusion: Music therapy can improve the overall quality of life of patients with cancer, with an observed optimal intervention duration of 1-2 months. Meanwhile, anxiety, depression and pain are improved as well. Nevertheless, high-quality trials are still needed to further determine the effects of music intervention in supportive cancer care."

        "Abstract":"Purpose: The purposes of this study were to review the types of nurse-led nonpharmacological pain interventions (NPI) offered to cancer patients and\/or family caregivers, and to determine a comprehensive and robust estimate of the effect size of nurse-led NPI for cancer patients on various pain-related outcomes. Design: Systematic review and meta-analysis. Studies assessing nurse-led NPIs targeting cancer patients and published between January 2008 and December 2020 were identified by searching multiple literature databases, including MEDLINE® , EMBASE, Google Scholar, Cochrane Library, ProQuest Medical Library, and CINAHL® . Methods: This review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Item for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines. The selected randomized clinical trials were independently assessed for methodological quality. The effect sizes (ESs) of treatment were presented as standardized mean differences (Hedges' g) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Findings: A meta-analysis was performed to analyze data from 22 randomized clinical trials. Three types of nurse-led NPI were offered, mainly to cancer patients but also to some caregivers: music, physical, and psycho-educational interventions. The dose and duration of nonpharmacological interventions varied widely. The study participants ranged in age from 44.1 to 67.3 years. Meta-analysis indicated that, although these interventions had small effects in long-term (g = 0.24, 95% CI: 0.06-0.43, p = 0.011) to medium effects in short-term (g = 0.43, 95% CI: 0.32-0.53, p < 0.001), they significantly reduced patients' pain, increased their knowledge of pain management, reduced barriers to pain management and pain coping, and improved other physical and emotional symptoms. The significance of the ES differed according to the type of intervention, with psycho-educational and physical NPIs having a significant but medium short-term ES, whereas music NPI had a significant but large short-term ES. Only psycho-educational NPIs had significant long-term effects. Conclusion: The combined ES showed that these nurse-led NPIs were significantly effective in both the short and long-term. Types of intervention as a potential moderator were associated with short-term and long-term effects of nonpharmacological interventions on patient outcomes. Clinical relevance: Research-tested interventions should be provided to help patients cope effectively with pain."

Methods: The experiment will be implemented from June 2021 to June 2022 at Jinan Central Hospital. The experiment was granted through the Research Ethics Committee of Jinan Central Hospital (no.08847765). The inclusion criteria requires that the age of female patients ranges from 25 to 65 years old, and the pathological diagnosis of breast cancer requires radical mastectomy (containing extensive radical mastectomy and modified radical mastectomy). Patients who do not like to listen to music or have severe debilitating diseases or are allergic to the sound will be excluded. Patients in the intervention group are given music intervention, and in control group, patients do not receive any information about the music therapy in the period of this study. The primary outcome is quality of life, psychological distress. The secondary outcomes are the heart rate, blood pressure, as well as Visual Analog Scale (VAS). Results: Table 1 will illustrate the postoperative outcomes after music interventions between groups. Conclusion: Music intervention can improve the mental and physical health of the breast cancer patients. Trial registration: This study protocol was registered in Research Registry (researchregistry6168)."

We aimed to assess the efficacy of six-step music therapy in relieving pain and anxiety and improving sleep quality in lung cancer patients receiving platinum-based chemotherapy. Methods: Between March 2013 and October 2015, we enrolled a total of 100 patients who were diagnosed with small cell lung cancer and scheduled for platinum-based chemotherapy. Patients were randomly assigned to two groups: the music therapy group (received six-step music therapy, n=50) and the control group (not received six-step music therapy, n=50). The anxiety, pain, and sleep quality of all patients were assessed using the self-rating anxiety scale (SAS), the visual analogue scale (VAS), and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), respectively. Results: There were no significant differences in the demographic characteristics and music background between the two groups. The SAS and VAS scores in the two groups were not statistically different before chemotherapy. However, patients in the music therapy group showed significantly lower SAS and VAS scores compared with the control group at both 1 day and 5 days after chemotherapy. (SAS score at 1-day post-therapy, 49.48±2.14 vs 61.46±8.8, P=0.011; SAS score at 5-day post-therapy, 39.73±1.79 vs 62.02±8.83, P=0.005; VAS score at 1-day post-therapy, 2.14±0.78 vs 4.74±1.01, P=0.005; VAS score at 5-day post-therapy, 2.06±0.79 vs 4.74±1.08, P=0.004). In addition, the total PSQI score of patients who received music therapy was also significantly higher than that of the control group after therapy (total PSQI score at 1-day post-therapy, 8.50±1.69 vs 17.81±3.01, P=0.006; total PSQI score at 5-day post-chemotherapy, 9.84±3.02 vs 18.66±2.91, P=0.012). Conclusion: The music therapy was an effective approach in alleviating pain and anxiety and promoting sleep quality in lung cancer patients receiving platinum-based chemotherapy.

Methods: A total of 160 patients with breast cancer were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to receive usual care (UC), AT, MT, or combination therapy (CT) during perioperative periods. Pain intensity and anxiety scores were measured by visual analog scale. Interleukin (IL)-6 and high mobility group box 1 (HMGB-1) were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results: There was a significant group effect on pain, anxiety, and IL-6 and HMGB-1 levels, with the greatest improvement occurring in the CT group (P < .001). Compared with the UC group, the AT and MT groups had lower mean changes of pain intensity and IL-6 and HMGB-1 levels, and greater anxiety reduction (P < .001). However, the differences between the AT and MT groups did not reach significance (P > .05). Conclusion: In patients with breast cancer, perioperative CT achieves greater pain improvement and anxiety reduction and less marked increase in IL-6 and HMGB-1 levels. These results suggest that CT is an acceptable complementary and alternative medicine for breast cancer patients."

        "Abstract":"Background: Breast cancer remains the most important cancer among women worldwide. The disease itself and treatment may have a profound impact on the patients' psychological well being and quality of life. Depression is common in breast cancer patients and affects the therapeutic effects as well as prolongs the duration of hospital stay. However, few studies reported the effectiveness of music therapy on depression and duration of hospital stay of female patients with breast cancer after radical mastectomy. Methods: One hundred and twenty subjects were recruited to this clinical trial and randomly allocated to two groups. The experimental group (n = 60) received music therapy on the basis of routine nursing care, whereas the control group (n = 60) only received the routine nursing care. The whole intervention time was from the first day after radical mastectomy to the third time of admission to hospital for chemotherapy. Data of demographic characteristics and depression were collected by using the General Questionnaire and Chinese version of Zung Self-rating Depression Scale (ZSDS) respectively. One pre-test (the day before radical mastectomy) and three post-tests (the day before discharge from hospital, the second and third admission to hospital for chemotherapy) were utilized. Duration of hospital stay was calculated from the first day after radical mastectomy to the day of discharged from hospital. Results: The mean depression score of all subjects was 37.19 ± 6.30. Thirty-six cases (30%) suffered from depression symptoms, with 26 (72.2%) mild depression cases, 9 (25.0%) moderate depression cases, and 1 (2.8%) severe depression case. After music therapy, depression scores of the experimental group were lower than that of the control group in the three post-tests, with significant differences (F = 39.13, P < 0.001; F = 82.09, P < 0.001). Duration of hospital stay after radical mastectomy of the experimental group ((13.62 ± 2.04) days) was shorter than that of the control group ((15.53 ± 2.75) days) with significant difference (t = -4.34, P < 0.001). Conclusions: Music therapy has positive effects on improving depression of female patients with breast cancer, and duration of hospital stay after radical mastectomy can be reduced. It is worthy of applying music therapy as an alternative way of nursing intervention in clinical nursing process of caring female patients with breast cancer."

        "Abstract":"Introduction: The study aimed to investigate the effect of music therapy on anxiety alleviation among cancer patients. Methods: A comprehensive literature research was performed in four electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science). Fifteen randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included. The risk of bias for the RCTs was evaluated by the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. Anxiety levels were extracted to synthesize the combined effect by using meta-analysis. All analyses were performed using R version 4.0.4. Results: In total, 15 RCTs met the inclusion criteria involving 1320 cancer patients (662 patients in the experimental group and 658 patients in the controlled group). The majority of interventions were performed with recorded music lasting for 15-60 minutes. Compared with standard care, music intervention had a moderate superiority of anxiety alleviation (SMD: -0.54, 95% CI: [-0.92, -0.16]). Discussion: Music intervention could reduce cancer-related anxiety moderately. Nevertheless, the result should be interpreted with caution as high heterogeneity in this pooled study. Well-designed trials with higher quality were still warranted in the future."

        "Abstract":"Background: Chemotherapy is the primary treatment for patients with advanced gastrointestinal cancer, but it has many adverse reactions, particularly nausea and vomiting. Music therapy can reduce anxiety symptoms, avoid the response to the human body under various stress conditions through psychological adjustment, and improve the adverse reactions of chemotherapy. Aim: To investigate the impact of music therapy on relieving gastrointestinal adverse reactions in chemotherapy for patients with digestive tract cancer by meta-analysis. Methods: EMBASE, PubMed, OVID, WoS, CNKI, CBM, and VIP database were all used for searching relevant literature, and the efficacy after treatment was combined for analysis and evaluation. Results: This study included seven articles. The results of meta-analysis indicated that music therapy could reduce the nausea symptom score of patients after chemotherapy [mean difference (MD) = -3.15, 95% confidence interval (CI): -4.62 to -1.68, Z = -4.20, P < 0.0001]. Music therapy could reduce the vomiting symptom score of patients after chemotherapy (MD = -2.28, 95%CI: -2.46 to -2.11, Z = -25.15, P < 0.0001). Furthermore, music therapy could minimize the incidence of grade I and above nausea or vomiting in patients after chemotherapy (odds ratio = 0.38, 95%CI: 0.26-0.56, Z = -4.88, P < 0.0001). Meta-regression analysis found that publication year was not a specific factor affecting the combined results. There was no significant publication bias (P > 0.05). Conclusion: Music therapy can significantly improve the scores of nausea and vomiting symptoms in patients with digestive system cancer during chemotherapy and reduce the incidence of grade I and above nausea and vomiting after chemotherapy, making it an effective psychological intervention method worthy of clinical promotion."

        "Abstract":"Purpose: To systematically synthesize the effect of music therapy interventions applied to patients with hematological cancer on fatigue. Methods: The searches were conducted on PubMed, Web of Science, EBSCOhost\/CINAHL Complete, Science Direct, Scopus, Cochrane Library, Ovid, ProQuest, and Springer Link databases until August 2021 without any year limitation. The review covered the period between 2003 and 2020. Comprehensive Meta-Analysis 3 software was used in the analysis of meta-analysis data. The meta-analysis was carried out following the PRISMA checklist. Risks of bias were examined by two independent researchers using the Cochrane Collaboration tool. Results: Six randomized controlled trials consisting of 279 participants were included in the systematic review and meta-analysis. The count of music therapy interventions in the included studies ranged between 1 and 8 sessions per participant, each of which was 20 to 45 min long. The music therapy interventions applied to patients with hematological cancers were found to be effective in reducing the severity of fatigue (95% Cl = 0.10 ~ 0.57; Hedge's g = 0.03; p = 0.006). Conclusions: The findings of the meta-analysis indicated that music therapy interventions made important and positive contributions to reducing fatigue in patients with hematological cancer. Music therapy interventions are a convenient method to reduce fatigue because they are comfortable and non-invasive. It will be beneficial to increase the awareness of nurses about the implementation of music therapy interventions. It is recommended that music therapy interventions applied to patients with a diagnosis of hematological cancer should be considered interventions that can be used together with other non-pharmacological or pharmacological methods to reduce fatigue."

        "Abstract":"Objective: Postoperative pain is caused by surgical injury and trauma; is stressful to patients; and includes a series of physiologic, psychological, and behavioral reactions. Effective postoperative analgesia helps improve postoperative pain, perioperative safety, and hospital discharge rates. This study aimed to observe the influence of postoperative intravenous sufentanil patient-controlled analgesia combined with music therapy versus sufentanil alone on hemodynamics and analgesia in patients with lung cancer. Methods: This was a randomized parallel study performed in 60 patients in American Society of Anesthesiologists class I or II undergoing lung cancer resection at the Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Xiangya School of Medicine, Central South University. Patients were randomly assigned to a music therapy (MT) group and a control (C) group. The MT group underwent preoperative and postoperative music intervention while the C group did not. Both groups received intravenous patient-controlled sufentanil analgesia. The primary outcome was the visual analogue scale (VAS) score at 24 hours after surgery. The secondary outcomes included hemodynamic changes (systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, heart rate), changes on the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), total consumption of sufentanil, number of uses, sedation, and adverse effects. The postoperative sufentanil dose and analgesia frequency were recorded. Results: Compared with the C group, the MT group had significantly lower VAS score, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, and SAS score within 24 hours after surgery (p < 0.01). In addition, postoperative analgesia frequency and sufentanil dose were reduced in the MT group (p < 0.01). Conclusions: Combined music therapy and sufentanil improves intravenous patient-controlled analgesia effects compared with sufentanil alone after lung cancer surgery. Lower doses of sufentanil could be administered to more effectively improve patients' cardiovascular parameters."

Methods: A total of 170 patients were randomly allocated to the intervention group (n = 85) receiving music therapy and progressive muscle relaxation training plus routine nursing care and the control group (n = 85) receiving routine nursing care. Music therapy and progressive muscle relaxation training were performed twice a day within 48 h after radical mastectomy, once in the early morning (6a.m.-8a.m.) and once in the evening (9p.m.-11p.m.), for 30 min per session until discharged from the hospital. Results: A general linear model with univariate analysis showed that the intervention group patients had significant improvement in depression and anxiety in the effects of group (F = 20.31, P < 0.001; F = 5.41, P = 0.017), time (F = 56.64, P < 0.001; F = 155.17, P < 0.001) and group*time interaction (F = 6.91, P = 0.009; F = 5.56, P = 0.019). The intervention group patients had shorter length of hospital stay (12.56 ± 1.03) than that of the control group (17.01 ± 2.46) with statistical significance (F = 13.36, P < 0.001). Conclusion: Music therapy and progressive muscle relaxation training can reduce depression, anxiety and length of hospital stay in female breast cancer patients after radical mastectomy."

Background: There is insufficient evidence on the effects of music therapy on state anxiety of breast cancer patients following radical mastectomy. Methods: A Hall's Core, Care, and Cure Model-based clinical trial was conducted in 120 female breast cancer patients from March to November 2009. A randomized controlled design was utilized. The patients were randomly allocated to the experimental group (n = 60) received music therapy in addition to routine nursing care, and the control group (n = 60) only received routine nursing care. A standardized questionnaire and the State Anxiety Inventory were applied. The primary endpoint was the state anxiety score measured at pretest (on the day before radical mastectomy) and at three post-tests (on the day before patients were discharged from hospital, the second and third time of admission to hospital for chemotherapy respectively). Results: The pretest score revealed that the majority of the patients had a moderate level (77·5%) and 15% had severe level of state anxiety. The repeated-measure ancova model analysis indicated that the mean state anxiety score was significantly lower in the experimental group than those in the control group at each of the three post-test measurements. The mean difference between the experimental and control group together with 95% confidence intervals were -4·57 (-6·33, -2·82), -8·91 (-10·75, -7·08) and -9·69 (-11·52, -7·85) at the 1st post-test, 2nd post-test and 3rd post-test respectively. Conclusion: Music therapy is found to have positive effects on decreasing state anxiety score."

        "Abstract":"Context: Depressive symptoms are prevalent and associated with greater healthcare utilization among hospitalized adults with cancer. Music therapy and massage therapy are available at many National Cancer Institute (NCI)-Designated Cancer Centers and recommended by the American Society of Clinical Oncology for depressive symptoms, but a paucity of studies have compared these two therapies. Objectives: We conducted a retrospective, multi-method program evaluation of single, first-time music therapy and massage therapy sessions delivered to hospitalized adults with cancer. Methods: The study was conducted at an NCI-Designated Comprehensive Cancer Center between February 2018 and October 2019. We assessed depressive symptoms with the Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS) depression item. We also invited patients to provide free-text comments describing their treatment experience. Results: Among 1764 patients (61.2% women, 72.7% white), 350 received music therapy and 1414 received massage therapy; music therapy was associated with a 0.4 point greater reduction (95% 0.3 to 0.6, P < 0.001) in the ESAS depression score relative to massage therapy. When analyses were restricted to the 452 (25.6%) patients with moderate-to-severe depressive symptoms (ESAS score ≥ 4), music therapy was associated with a 1.2 point greater reduction (95% CI 0.7 to 1.7, P < 0.001) relative to massage therapy, a clinically meaningful difference. In free-text comments, music therapy was described as energizing, uplifting, and evocative, whereas massage therapy was described as calming and relaxing. Conclusion: Among hospitalized adult cancer patients, both music therapy and massage therapy were associated with reduced depressive symptoms, but music therapy was associated with a greater reduction than massage therapy."

The treatment group received classical music that had been modified based on spectral alterations specific to their tinnitus characteristics. Tinnitus and psychological functioning were assessed at baseline and 3, 6, and 12 months after initial testing using self-reports. Participants, investigators and research assistants were blinded from group assignment. Results: Data from 34 participants were analyzed. The treatment group reported significantly lower levels of tinnitus distress (primary outcome, assessed using the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory) than the control group throughout the follow-up period. Among the treatment group, there were statistically significant and clinically meaningful levels of reduction in tinnitus distress, severity, and functional impairment at 3- and 6-month follow-ups, which was sustained at the 12-month follow-up. Conclusion: The personalized music therapy was effective in reducing subjective tinnitus and represents a meaningful advancement in tinnitus intervention."

We have developed a smartphone application using tailor-made notched music for tinnitus patients. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of this smartphone application on reducing tinnitus. In addition, we investigated the predictive factors for tinnitus treatment outcome using this smartphone application. Methods: A total of 26 patients who were chronically distressed by tinnitus with a ≥18 Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI) score were recruited from March 2013 to March 2015 (National Clinical Trial (NCT) Identifier Number 01663467). Patients were instructed to listen to tailor-made notched music through our smartphone application for 30-60min per day and were prescribed Ginkgo biloba for 3 months. Treatment outcome was evaluated using the THI, a visual analogue scale that measures the effects of tinnitus in terms of loudness, noticeable time, annoyance, and disruption of daily life. Demographic data, including age, sex, duration of tinnitus, and pre-treatment scores on questionnaires such as the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), State Trait Anxiety Inventory (TAI), and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) scores were compared between the effective and non-effective groups according to the differences between their pre- and post-treatment THI scores. Results: Smartphone application-delivered notched music therapy and Ginko combined treatment improved the THI score from 33.9±18.9 to 23.1±15.2; the effect was particularly marked for the emotional score of the THI. Improvement in the THI score was positively correlated with the initial THI score (P=0.001, adjusted estimated value=0.49, 95% confidence interval=0.25-0.73). Conclusion: Chronic tinnitus patients who underwent smartphone application-delivered notched music therapy and Ginko combined treatment showed improved THI scores, particularly the emotional score of the THI. A smartphone application-delivered therapy and Ginko combined treatment may be more effective in tinnitus patients who have had a higher initial THI."

        "Abstract":"Objectives: Tinnitus is a very common symptom, yet the quest for an effective treatment is challenging. Results from several clinical trials support the notion that neuro-music therapy is an effective means to reduce tinnitus distress with short duration and long lasting effect. However, until now, the effectiveness has not been tested in a controlled trial against an active comparator. Methods: The trial was designed as two-center, parallel intervention group controlled study with two intervention groups: Counseling (50minute individualized personal instruction) or neuro-music therapy (counseling plus eight 50-minute sessions of individualized music therapy). Data of n=290 patients suffering from chronic tinnitus were analyzed. Outcome measure was the change in Tinnitus Questionnaire Total Scores (TQ) from baseline (admission) to end of treatment. Results: Both treatment groups achieved a statistically relevant reduction in TQ scores, though 66% of patients in the music therapy group attained a clinically meaningful improvement compared to 33% in the counseling group. A binary logistic regression revealed two variables significantly influencing therapy outcome: initial tinnitus score and type of therapy with an OR for the music therapy compared to the counseling of 4.34 (CI 2.33-8.09). Conclusions: Counseling is an appropriate treatment option with well above chance of improvement. The neuro-music therapy outperformed the counseling. This treatment targets the tinnitus sound itself, is short in duration, intrinsically motivating and easy to operate and thus presents a possible complement to the therapeutic spectrum in chronic tinnitus. The trial was registered at the ClinicalTrials.gov registry (ID: NCT01845155)."

        "Abstract":"Background: Tinnitus is the perception of a phantom sound without external acoustic stimulation. Recent tinnitus research suggests a relationship between attention processes and tinnitus-related distress. It has been found that too much focus on tinnitus comes at the expense of the visual domain. The angular gyrus (AG) seems to play a crucial role in switching attention to the most salient stimulus. This study aims to evaluate the involvement of the AG during visual attention tasks in tinnitus sufferers treated with Heidelberg Neuro-Music Therapy (HNMT), an intervention that has been shown to reduce tinnitus-related distress. Methods: Thirty-three patients with chronic tinnitus, 45 patients with recent-onset tinnitus, and 35 healthy controls were tested. A fraction of these (21\/21\/22) were treated with the \"compact\" version of the HNMT lasting 1 week with intense treatments, while non-treated participants were included as passive controls. Visual attention was evaluated during functional Magnet-Resonance Imaging (fMRI) by a visual Continous Performance Task (CPT) using letter-based alarm cues (\"O\" and \"X\") appearing in a sequence of neutral letters, \"A\" through \"H.\" Participants were instructed to respond via button press only if the letter \"O\" was followed by the letter \"X\" (GO condition), but not to respond if a neutral letter appeared instead (NOGO condition). All participants underwent two fMRI sessions, before and after a 1-week study period. Results: The CPT results revealed a relationship between error rates and tinnitus duration at baseline whereby the occurrence of erroneous \"GO omissions\" and the reaction time increased with tinnitus duration. Patients with chronic tinnitus who were treated with HNMT had decreasing error rates (fewer GO omissions) compared to treated recent-onset patients. fMRI analyses confirmed greater activation of the AG during CPT in chronic patients after HNMT treatment compared to treated recent-onset patients. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that HNMT treatment helps shift the attention from the auditory phantom percept toward visual cues in chronic tinnitus patients and that this shift in attention may involve the AG."

The aim of this study was to investigate effects of combination of the specific music and educational counseling on tinnitus relief in short term. Methods: Sixty patients suffering from chronic tinnitus were included. The non-randomized controlled study was designed with two intervention groups: educational counseling (EC, which included a 1-h individualized instruction) and preferred music therapy [PMT, which included EC plus 15, 30-min preferred music sessions (PMS)]. Three assessments-the Chinese-Mandarin version of Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI-CM), Tinnitus Evaluation Questionnaire (TEQ), and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) were administered before and 1, 2, 3 weeks after initiation of treatment to evaluate the efficacy. Results: Twenty-six patients in PMT group attained a clinically meaningful improvement in THI compared to 15 in the EC group, though both groups achieved a statistically relevant reduction in the 3 assessments. Conclusion: The PMT had a positive impact on chronic tinnitus and related distress in a short term. It outperformed the separate EC, which is an appropriate treatment option in clinic. Therefore, it presents a possible complement to the therapeutic spectrum in chronic tinnitus. Trial registration: Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, ChiCTR1900022624. Registered on 19 April 2019."

        "Abstract":"Tinnitus represents one of the most common and distressing otologic problems, and it causes various somatic and psychological disorders that interfere with the quality of life. This study aimed to compare the outcome of music therapy, tinnitus maskers and pharmacotherapy on patients with chronic tinnitus, to observe and analyse the etiological factors of tinnitus and to find out whether music can be used as an active listening mode by which tinnitus perception can be decreased. This was a comparative longitudinal study involving 90 patients with chronic tinnitus who were randomly assigned to 3 groups of 30 each: Group A (Music therapy), Group B (Pharmacotherapy) and Group C (Tinnitus masker). After a detailed clinical history and examination, Tinnitus Handicap Inventory and Visual Analogue Scores were recorded both prior to and following therapy, and patient were followed up monthly up to 2 months. There is a significant difference in the mean THI score (p = 0.002) and mean VAS(p = 0.0006) at 2 months follow up in patients treated with Music therapy and patients had a satisfactory outcome after music therapy and did not require any further treatment. Patients in pharmacotherapy and hearing aid group had a good clinical improvement but mean THI and mean VAS score was not statically significant. It was also noticed that loud noise exposure and hypertension were main etiological factors in 37.77% and 26% of patients respectively. Music therapy appears to be an effective and cost-efficient mode of therapy for chronic tinnitus and could be suitable for widespread implementation for patients with tinnitus of varying severity. Pharmacotherapy and hearing aid application in the treatment of tinnitus has good outcome in our study but requires long term treatment and follow up."

        "Abstract":"Pathophysiology and treatment of tinnitus still are fields of intensive research. The neuroscientifically motivated Heidelberg Model of Music Therapy, previously developed by the German Center for Music Therapy Research, Heidelberg, Germany, was applied to explore its effects on individual distress and on brain structures. This therapy is a compact and fast application of nine consecutive 50-min sessions of individualized therapy implemented over 1 week. Clinical improvement and long-term effects over several years have previously been published. However, the underlying neural basis of the therapy's success has not yet been explored. In the current study, the therapy was applied to acute tinnitus patients (TG) and healthy active controls (AC). Non-treated patients were also included as passive controls (PTC). As predicted, the therapeutic intervention led to a significant decrease of tinnitus-related distress in TG compared to PTC. Before and after the study week, high-resolution MRT scans were obtained for each subject. Assessment by repeated measures design for several groups (Two-Way ANOVA) revealed structural gray matter (GM) increase in TG compared to PTC, comprising clusters in precuneus, medial superior frontal areas, and in the auditory cortex. This pattern was further applied as mask for general GM changes as induced by the therapy week. The therapy-like procedure in AC also elicited similar GM increases in precuneus and frontal regions. Comparison between structural effects in TG vs. AC was calculated within the mask for general GM changes to obtain specific effects in tinnitus patients, yielding GM increase in right Heschl's gyrus, right Rolandic operculum, and medial superior frontal regions. In line with recent findings on the crucial role of the auditory cortex in maintaining tinnitus-related distress, a causative relation between the therapy-related GM alterations in auditory areas and the long-lasting therapy effects can be assumed."

Methods: A prospective randomized controlled study was conducted in a provincial hospital in southeast China. The subjects were randomly divided into the music therapy (MT) group and the control group. Both groups were given standardized sedation treatment and routine nursing. Infants in the MT group received 60 min of MT three times a day. The sedation medication, Richmond sedation agitation scale (RASS) score, incidence of delirium, mechanical ventilation duration, length of cardiac intensive care unit (CICU) stay, restraint belt use time, and successful ventilation withdrawal rate were collected. Results: Infants in the control group had a higher total amount of on-demand midazolam (p = .039). Infants in the MT group had a significantly lower incidence of delirium, shorter mechanical ventilation duration, and restraint band use time (p = .047, p = .046, and p = .038, respectively). Although infants in the MT group had a higher success rate of ventilation withdrawal, lower RASS scores, and shorter ICU stay, the difference was not statistically significant (p = .427, p = .585, and p = .068, respectively). Conclusion: MT in the ICU can reduce the use of on-demand sedative drugs, shorten mechanical ventilation, and reduce the occurrence of delirium in infants who underwent mechanical ventilation after cardiac surgery. MT is a safe and reliable treatment and worthy of clinical application."

        "Abstract":"Background: Endotracheal suctioning has been identified as a painful procedure for critically ill patients. Aim: To determine the effect of music therapy on pain intensity, sedation level and physiological parameters during endotracheal suctioning of mechanically ventilated patients in cardiovascular surgery intensive care unit (ICU). Design: Experimental survey. Methods: The study was conducted between May 2010 and June 2013 in Ordu Medical Park Hospital Cardiovascular Surgery Intensive Care Unit. The study sample consisted of 66 patients (33 experimental and 33 control) who complied with the criteria of inclusion for the study. Data was collected using the 'Patient Information Form', 'Critical-Care Pain Observation Tool', 'Ramsay Sedation Scale' and 'Form of Physiological Parameters'. Results: The mean scores of the Ramsay Sedation Scale during endotracheal aspiration were respectively 1·88 and 1·55 in the experimental and control group and the difference between the groups was statistically significant (p = 0·003). The mean score of Critical-Care Pain Observation Tool during endotracheal suctioning in the experimental group was found to be lower statistically than those of the control group (p < 0·001). There were no significant differences before, during and 20 min after suctioning between the two groups with regard to systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, heart rate and oxygen saturation (p > 0·05). Conclusions: The results of this study implies that music therapy can be effective practice for nurses attempting to reduce patients' pain and control sedation level in patients on mechanical ventilators during endotracheal suctioning. Relevance to clinical practice: It is recommended that music therapy should be added to the routine nursing care for mechanically ventilated patients."

        "Abstract":"Aims and objectives: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of music on the anxiety of patients on mechanical ventilation, as assessed by objective parameters and a subjective validated anxiety scale. Background: Mechanical ventilation, although sometimes lifesaving, is often associated with levels of anxiety requiring sedatives, which has inevitable implications on costs and complications. Design: A randomized controlled trial design. Methods: A total of 64 subjects was randomly assigned to undergo either 30 minutes of music intervention or a rest period. The subjects were asked to answer the Chinese State Trait Anxiety Inventory scale before and after the study period and physiological indices and resting behaviours were recorded before and after the study period in both groups. The subjects' satisfaction with music was also obtained after music intervention. Results: The findings indicate that patients on mechanical ventilation that listened to a single 30-minute session of music appeared to show greater relaxation as manifested by a decrease in physiological indices and an increase in comfortable resting behaviours. Conclusion: Music can provide an effective method of reducing potentially harmful physiological responses arising from anxiety in mechanically ventilated patients. Relevance to clinical practice: As indicated by the results of this study, music therapy can act as a simple and safe nursing intervention to allay anxiety and promote patient comfort. Interest and comments on music therapy provided as a relaxation technique should be elicited from both nurses and patients."

        "Abstract":"Background: Mechanical ventilation often causes major distress and anxiety in patients. The sensation of breathlessness, frequent suctioning, inability to talk, uncertainty regarding surroundings or condition, discomfort, isolation from others, and fear contribute to high levels of anxiety. Side effects of analgesia and sedation may lead to the prolongation of mechanical ventilation and, subsequently, to a longer length of hospitalization and increased cost. Therefore, non-pharmacological interventions should be considered for anxiety and stress management. Music interventions have been used to reduce anxiety and distress and improve physiological functioning in medical patients; however, their efficacy for mechanically ventilated patients needs to be evaluated. This review was originally published in 2010 and was updated in 2014. Objectives: To update the previously published review that examined the effects of music therapy or music medicine interventions (as defined by the authors) on anxiety and other outcomes in mechanically ventilated patients. Specifically, the following objectives are addressed in this review.1. To conduct a meta-analysis to compare the effects of participation in standard care combined with music therapy or music medicine interventions with standard care alone.2. To compare the effects of patient-selected music with researcher-selected music.3. To compare the effects of different types of music interventions (e.g., music therapy versus music medicine). Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2014, Issue 2), MEDLINE (1950 to March 2014), CINAHL (1980 to March 2014), EMBASE (1980 to March 2014), PsycINFO (1967 to March 2014), LILACS (1982 to March 2014), Science Citation Index (1980 to March 2014), www.musictherapyworld.net (1 March 2008) (database is no longer functional), CAIRSS for Music (to March 2014), Proquest Digital Dissertations (1980 to March 2014), ClinicalTrials.gov (2000 to March 2014), Current Controlled Trials (1998 to March 2014), the National Research Register (2000 to September 2007), and NIH CRISP (all to March 2014). We handsearched music therapy journals and reference lists, and contacted relevant experts to identify unpublished manuscripts. There was no language restriction. The original search was performed in January 2010. Selection criteria: We included all randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials that compared music interventions and standard care with standard care alone for mechanically ventilated patients. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently extracted the data and assessed the methodological quality of included studies. We contacted authors to obtain missing data where needed. Where possible, results for continuous outcomes were presented in meta-analyses using mean differences and standardized mean differences. Post-test scores were used. In cases of significant baseline difference, we used change scores. For dichotomous outcomes, we presented the results as risk ratios. Main results: We identified six new trials for this update. In total, the evidence for this review rests on 14 trials (805 participants). Music listening was the main intervention used, and 13 of the studies did not include a trained music therapist. Results indicated that music listening may be beneficial for anxiety reduction in mechanically ventilated patients. Specifically, music listening resulted, on average, in an anxiety reduction that was 1.11 standard deviation units greater (95% CI -1.75 to -0.47, P = 0.0006) than in the standard care group. This is considered a large and clinically significant effect. Findings indicated that listening to music consistently reduced respiratory rate and systolic blood pressure, suggesting a relaxation response. Furthermore, one large-scale study reported greater reductions in sedative and analgesic intake in the music listening group compared to the control group, and two other studies reported trends for reduction in sedative and analgesic intake for the music group. One study found significantly higher sedation scores in the music listening group compared to the control group.No strong evidence was found for reduction in diastolic blood pressure and mean arterial pressure. Furthermore, inconsistent results were found for reduction in heart rate with seven studies reporting greater heart rate reductions in the music listening group and one study a slightly greater reduction in the control group. Music listening did not improve oxygen saturation levels.Four studies examined the effects of music listening on hormone levels but the results were mixed and no conclusions could be drawn.No strong evidence was found for an effect of music listening on mortality rate but this evidence rested on only two trials.Most trials were assessed to be at high risk of bias because of lack of blinding. Blinding of outcome assessors is often impossible in music therapy and music medicine studies that use subjective outcomes, unless the music intervention is compared to another treatment intervention. Because of the high risk of bias, these results need to be interpreted with caution.No studies could be found that examined the effects of music interventions on quality of life, patient satisfaction, post-discharge outcomes, or cost-effectiveness. No adverse events were identified. Authors' conclusions: This updated systematic review indicates that music listening may have a beneficial effect on anxiety in mechanically ventilated patients. These findings are consistent with the findings of three other Cochrane systematic reviews on the use of music interventions for anxiety reduction in medical patients. The review furthermore suggests that music listening consistently reduces respiratory rate and systolic blood pressure. Finally, results indicate a possible beneficial impact on the consumption of sedatives and analgesics. Therefore, we conclude that music interventions may provide a viable anxiety management option to mechanically ventilated patients."

        "Abstract":"Importance: Alternatives to sedative medications, such as music, may alleviate the anxiety associated with ventilatory support. Objective: To test whether listening to self-initiated patient-directed music (PDM) can reduce anxiety and sedative exposure during ventilatory support in critically ill patients. Design, setting, and patients: Randomized clinical trial that enrolled 373 patients from 12 intensive care units (ICUs) at 5 hospitals in the Minneapolis-St Paul, Minnesota, area receiving acute mechanical ventilatory support for respiratory failure between September 2006 and March 2011. Of the patients included in the study, 86% were white, 52% were female, and the mean (SD) age was 59 (14) years. The patients had a mean (SD) Acute Physiology, Age and Chronic Health Evaluation III score of 63 (21.6) and a mean (SD) of 5.7 (6.4) study days. Interventions: Self-initiated PDM (n = 126) with preferred selections tailored by a music therapist whenever desired while receiving ventilatory support, self-initiated use of noise-canceling headphones (NCH; n = 122), or usual care (n = 125). Main outcomes and measures: Daily assessments of anxiety (on 100-mm visual analog scale) and 2 aggregate measures of sedative exposure (intensity and frequency). Results: Patients in the PDM group listened to music for a mean (SD) of 79.8 (126) (median [range], 12 [0-796]) minutes\/day. Patients in the NCH group wore the noise-abating headphones for a mean (SD) of 34.0 (89.6) (median [range], 0 [0-916]) minutes\/day. The mixed-models analysis showed that at any time point, patients in the PDM group had an anxiety score that was 19.5 points lower (95% CI, -32.2 to -6.8) than patients in the usual care group (P = .003). By the fifth study day, anxiety was reduced by 36.5% in PDM patients. The treatment × time interaction showed that PDM significantly reduced both measures of sedative exposure. Compared with usual care, the PDM group had reduced sedation intensity by -0.18 (95% CI, -0.36 to -0.004) points\/day (P = .05) and had reduced frequency by -0.21 (95% CI, -0.37 to -0.05) points\/day (P = .01). The PDM group had reduced sedation frequency by -0.18 (95% CI, -0.36 to -0.004) points\/day vs the NCH group (P = .04). By the fifth study day, the PDM patients received 2 fewer sedative doses (reduction of 38%) and had a reduction of 36% in sedation intensity. Conclusions and relevance: Among ICU patients receiving acute ventilatory support for respiratory failure, PDM resulted in greater reduction in anxiety compared with usual care, but not compared with NCH. Concurrently, PDM resulted in greater reduction in sedation frequency compared with usual care or NCH, and greater reduction in sedation intensity compared with usual care, but not compared with NCH.

Background: Few studies have focused on the effect of music on physiological signs of anxiety in patients receiving mechanical ventilatory support. Design: A study-case-control, experimental repeated measures design was used. Method: Sixty patients aged 18-70 years, receiving mechanical ventilatory support and hospitalised in the intensive care unit, were taken as a convenience sample. Participants were randomised to a control group or intervention group, who received 60 minutes of music therapy. Classical music was played to patients using media player (MP3) and headphones. Subjects had physiological signs taken immediately before the intervention and at the 30th, 60th and 90th minutes of the intervention. Physiological signs of anxiety assessed in this study were mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate, respiratory rate and oxygen saturation in blood measured by pulse oxymetry. Data were collected over eight months in 2006-2007. Results: The music group had significantly lower respiratory rates, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure, than the control group. This decrease improved progressively in the 30th, 60th and 90th minutes of the intervention, indicating a cumulative dose effect. Conclusion: Music can provide an effective method of reducing potentially harmful physiological responses arising from anxiety. Relevance to clinical practice: As indicated by the results of this study, music therapy can be supplied to allay anxiety in patients receiving mechanical ventilation. Nurses may include music therapy in the routine care of patients receiving mechanical ventilation."

Materials and methods: This study was a randomized controlled trial. The sample of the study included 98 patients with mechanical ventilation support who met the selection criteria. The patients were randomly assigned to control and music therapy groups. Patients in the control group were routinely suctioned as usual. Patients in the music group received music therapy 20 min before, during, and 20 min after endotracheal suctioning. The primary outcome was the pain relief during suctioning. Results: Forty patients in each arm completed the study. Pain scores in the Critical Care Pain Observation Tool and Behavioral Pain Scale were lower in the music group than in the control group during endotracheal suctioning (group: F = 14.85, p = 0.000; F = 9.04, p = 0.000, respectively). It was also found to be a significant interaction effect between the groups and time (group × time: F = 17.35, p = 0.000; F = 18.00, p = 0.000, respectively). Conclusion: The Critical Care Pain Observation Tool and Behavioral Pain Scale in the current study generally demonstrated similar pain scores during the painful procedure. Our findings support that music therapy may act as a nonpharmacological therapy to relieve procedural pain in patients on mechanical ventilation."

Aims: To examine the feasibility of a randomised trial of music therapy for inpatients with schizophrenia, and explore its effects on mental health. Method: Up to 12 weeks of individual music therapy plus standard care were compared with standard care alone. Masked assessments of mental health, global functioning and satisfaction with care were conducted at 3 months. Results: Of 115 eligible patients 81 (70%) were randomised. Two-thirds of those randomised to music therapy attended at least four sessions (median attendance, eight sessions). Multivariate analysis demonstrated a trend towards improved symptom scores among those randomised to music therapy, especially in general symptoms of schizophrenia. Conclusions: A randomised trial of music therapy for in-patients with schizophrenia is feasible. The effects and cost-effectiveness of music therapy for acute psychosis should be further explored in an explanatory randomised trial."

        "Abstract":"To evaluate the efficacy of adjunct music therapy on patients with schizophrenia, we conducted a meta-analysis of currently available randomized controlled trials and controlled clinical trials. Eight electronic databases (CNKI, PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, Web of Science, Psychology and behavioural Sciences Collection, and Medline) were systematically searched from inception to January 2020. Standard mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence interval (CI) values were used to evaluate the effects of music therapy. Finally, we selected eighteen studies comprising 1,212 participants comparing with control conditions. The meta-analysis demonstrated that adjunct music therapy significantly improved total symptoms (SMD = -0.48, 95%CI: -0.74 to -0.22), negative symptoms (SMD=-0.56, 95%CI: -0.72 to -0.40), depression symptoms (SMD = -0.35, 95% CI: -0.54 to -0.17), and quality of life (SMD = 0.35, 95%CI: 0.07 to 0.62) in people with schizophrenia compared with the control group. In addition, the meta-analysis indicated no publication bias for total symptoms, negative symptoms, and positive symptoms. The sensitivity analysis showed that the result was reliable. But the quality of evidence is still low, more well-designed studies with larger sample size and high quality are needed to confirm the efficiency of adjunct music therapy in treating schizophrenia."

Materials and methods: This semi-experimental study was conducted using pre- and post-tests with a control group. The study population consists of patients with schizophrenia who regularly attended community mental health centers in the Malatya and Elazığ provinces of Turkey between May 2015 and September 2015. The study's sample consists of 70 patients with schizophrenia (n=35 in the control group; n=35 in the experimental group) who were selected randomly based on power analysis. The \"Patient Information Form,\" the \"Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS)\" and the \"Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia (CDSS)\" were used for data collection. Patients in the experimental group participated in relaxation exercises and music therapy 5 times a week for 4 weeks. The experimental group of 35 persons was divided into three groups of approximately 10-12 individuals in order to enable all participants to attend the program. No intervention was applied to the patients in the control group. The data were evaluated using percentage distribution, arithmetic means, standard deviations, Chi-square and independent samples t-tests. Results: The study found that patients in the experimental group showed a decrease in total mean scores on the BPRS and CDSS; the difference between the post-test scores of the experimental group and the post-test scores of the control group was statistically significant (p<0.05). The practice of relaxation exercises and music therapy was proven to be effective in reducing schizophrenic patients' psychological symptoms and levels of depression. Conclusion: Relaxation exercises and music therapy can be used as a complementary therapy in the medical treatment of patients with chronic schizophrenia."

Subjects and methods: Eighty patients with schizophrenia were randomly assigned to a music intervention group (MIG) or usual care group (UCG). Both groups received similar medical and routine care. The MIG received a 60-min group music therapy twice a week, a total of ten sessions. The UAG only received the usual care with no music therapy. Psychiatric symptoms and depression assessments were conducted using the positive and negative syndrome scale and the depression scale for schizophrenia at baseline, the posttest, and at a 3-month follow-up. Results: Thirty-eight patients in the MIG and 42 in the UCG completed the study. After 10 sessions of group music therapy, the groups showed statistically significant differences in psychiatric symptoms (p<.05) and depression status (p<.05). Conclusion: Group music therapy is an economical and easily implemented method of improving depression and psychiatric symptoms in patients with schizophrenia."

        "Abstract":"Background: Music therapy is a therapeutic approach that uses musical interaction as a means of communication and expression. Within the area of serious mental disorders, the aim of the therapy is to help people improve their emotional and relational competencies, and address issues they may not be able to using words alone. Objectives: To review the effects of music therapy, or music therapy added to standard care, compared with placebo therapy, standard care or no treatment for people with serious mental disorders such as schizophrenia. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Trials Study-Based Register (December 2010 and 15 January, 2015) and supplemented this by contacting relevant study authors, handsearching of music therapy journals and manual searches of reference lists. Selection criteria: All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared music therapy with standard care, placebo therapy, or no treatment. Data collection and analysis: Review authors independently selected, quality assessed and data extracted studies. We excluded data where more than 30% of participants in any group were lost to follow-up. We synthesised non-skewed continuous endpoint data from valid scales using a standardised mean difference (SMD). We employed a fixed-effect model for all analyses. If statistical heterogeneity was found, we examined treatment dosage (i.e. number of therapy sessions) and treatment approach as possible sources of heterogeneity. Main results: Ten new studies have been added to this update; 18 studies with a total 1215 participants are now included. These examined effects of music therapy over the short, medium, and long-term, with treatment dosage varying from seven to 240 sessions. Overall, most information is from studies at low or unclear risk of biasA positive effect on global state was found for music therapy compared to standard care (medium term, 2 RCTs, n = 133, RR 0.38 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.24 to 0.59, low-quality evidence, number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome NNTB 2, 95% CI 2 to 4). No binary data were available for other outcomes. Medium-term continuous data identified good effects for music therapy on negative symptoms using the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (3 RCTs, n = 177, SMD - 0.55 95% CI -0.87 to -0.24, low-quality evidence). General mental state endpoint scores on the Positive and Negative Symptoms Scale were better for music therapy (2 RCTs, n = 159, SMD -0.97 95% CI -1.31 to -0.63, low-quality evidence), as were average endpoint scores on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (1 RCT, n = 70, SMD -1.25 95% CI -1.77 to -0.73, moderate-quality evidence). Medium-term average endpoint scores using the Global Assessment of Functioning showed no effect for music therapy on general functioning (2 RCTs, n = 118, SMD -0.19 CI -0.56 to 0.18, moderate-quality evidence). However, positive effects for music therapy were found for both social functioning (Social Disability Screening Schedule scores; 2 RCTs, n = 160, SMD -0.72 95% CI -1.04 to -0.40), and quality of life (General Well-Being Schedule scores: 1 RCT, n = 72, SMD 1.82 95% CI 1.27 to 2.38, moderate-quality evidence). There were no data available for adverse effects, service use, engagement with services, or cost. Authors' conclusions: Moderate- to low-quality evidence suggests that music therapy as an addition to standard care improves the global state, mental state (including negative and general symptoms), social functioning, and quality of life of people with schizophrenia or schizophrenia-like disorders. However, effects were inconsistent across studies and depended on the number of music therapy sessions as well as the quality of the music therapy provided. Further research should especially address the long-term effects of music therapy, dose-response relationships, as well as the relevance of outcome measures in relation to music therapy."

        "Abstract":"Background: Music therapy (MT) has been used as adjunct therapy for schizophrenia for decades. However, its role is still inconclusive. A recent meta-analysis demonstrated that MT for schizophrenic patients only significantly benefits negative symptoms and mood symptoms rather than positive symptoms. In addition, the association between specific characteristics of MT and the treatment effect remains unclear. The aim of this study was to update the published data and to explore the role of music therapy in adjunct treatment in schizophrenia with a thorough meta-analysis. Methods: We compared the treatment effect in schizophrenic patients with standard treatment who did and did not receive adjunct MT through a meta-analysis, and investigated the clinical characteristics of MT through meta-regression. Results: The main finding was that the treatment effect was significantly better in the patients who received adjunct MT than in those who did not, in negative symptoms, mood symptoms, and also positive symptoms (all p < 0.05). This significance did not change after dividing the patients into subgroups of different total duration of MT, amounts of sessions, or frequency of MT. Besides, the treatment effect on the general symptoms was significantly positively associated with the whole duration of illness, indicating that MT would be beneficial for schizophrenic patients with a chronic course. Conclusions: Our meta-analysis highlights a significantly better treatment effect in schizophrenic patients who received MT than in those who did not, especially in those with a chronic course, regardless of the duration, frequency, or amounts of sessions of MT. These findings provide evidence that clinicians should apply MT for schizophrenic patients to alleviate disease severity."

[Participants and Methods] This randomized crossover comparative study included in-patients diagnosed with COPD and a ratio of forced expiratory volume measured at the first second and forced vital capacity (FEV1\/FVC) of <70% after administration of a bronchodilator. Patients were randomly divided into two groups that received either PR only or MT and PR (n=13 each). The PR program included conditioning, respiratory muscle training, and endurance training, whereas the MT program included vocal, singing, and breathing exercises using a keyboard harmonica. The programs lasted 8 weeks, in which pre- and post-intervention data were compared every 4 weeks. [Results] The FEV1\/FVC in the MT group improved after the intervention. Expiratory volume control was obtained better with feedback by sound than with expiration practice. In the MT and PR program, it was easier to adjust the timing and volume of breathing, obtain expiratory volume control, and, thus, improve FEV1\/FVC than in conventional practice. [Conclusion] Combining MT with PR improves parameters of pulmonary function in patients with COPD. Music therapy is a novel approach that, in combination with PR, may be used in COPD management."

        "Abstract":"Background: Music therapy, as a non-drug therapy, is widely used in patients with COPD. However, the effects of music therapy on dyspnea, anxiety, depression and other physiological parameters has not been elucidated. Therefore, we sought to investigate the effects of passive music therapy (listening to music) and mixed music (combination of listening and singing) in adults with COPD. Methods: A systematic literature search was performed in PubMed, Cochrane, Embase, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, VIP, and Wanfang Data up to June 26, 2019. All randomized controlled trials that compared music with usual care or other non-musical types of intervention in subjects with COPD were included in the study. The risk of bias for randomized controlled trials was assessed with the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Outcomes included dyspnea, anxiety, depression, sleep quality, and quality of life, as well as physiological parameters (eg, blood pressure and breathing frequency). Results: After initial screening of 216 potentially relevant records, 59 studies were eligible, and 12 studies with 812 participates met the inclusion criteria and were included in the final meta-analysis. Analysis showed that music therapy had a significant effect in relieving dyspnea (mean difference: -0.69, 95% CI -0.80 to -0.58, P < .001) and anxiety (standardized mean difference: -1.87, 95% CI -2.72 to -1.02, P < .001) in adults with COPD. Compared with the control group, music had no statistically significant effect on depression or St George Respiratory Questionnaire score. However, when it came to improving sleep quality, music reduced the total Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index score (P < .001). In addition, the pooled results showed that there was a significant improvement in systolic blood pressure (mean difference: -7.45, 95% CI -10.95 to -3.96, P < .001) and diastolic blood pressure (mean difference: -4.07, 95% CI -7.03 to -1.12, P = .007) in the music group compared to the control. Conclusions: Music therapy is effective in reducing dyspnea and anxiety in subjects with COPD. Additionally, music therapy may also improve sleep quality and physiological parameters of subjects with COPD. However, our conclusions need to be supported further by larger and longer well-designed trials."

        "Abstract":"Pulmonary rehabilitation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) includes a multidisciplinary approach of exercise and pursed-lip diaphragmatic breathing. Pursed-lip diaphragmatic breathing reduces alveolar collapse during exhalation, and diaphragmatic breathing improves inspiratory pressures. Harmonica playing has maneuvers similar to those taught in pursed-lip diaphragmatic breathing, with diaphragmatic breathing to create musical tones. Hence, we designed a trial to determine whether patients with COPD would benefit from harmonica playing. COPD patients who completed pulmonary rehabilitation at least 6 months prior were eligible for this trial. Patients attended 12 weeks of harmonica training sessions for 2 hours a week and were encouraged to practice at home. Participants completed pre- and postspirometry testing, maximum inspired and expired pressure (PImax, PEmax) testing, and 6-minute walk tests. Eleven of the 14 participants completed the 12-week trial. PImax and PEmax increased by an average of 15.4 ± 12.0 cm H2O (P = 0.0017) and 14.4 ± 14.0 cm H2O (P = 0.0061), respectively. Additionally, 6-minute walk distance increased by approximately 60 m (61 ± 78, P = 0.03). This pilot study showed that a 12-week harmonica program significantly improved PImax, PEmax, and 6-minute walk distance in COPD patients after rehabilitation. Larger-scale harmonica studies are warranted to evaluate this program's adjunctive potential benefit to formal pulmonary rehabilitation."

Music therapy group treatment including music visualization, wind playing and singing was provided weekly. This was compared with standard care treatment. Adults ages 48 to 88 (mean 70.1) with moderate to severe GOLD stage II-IV lung disease as well as other diseases processes that lead to chronic airflow limitations were included (n = 98). Participants in both conditions were followed from baseline enrollment to six weeks post control\/treatment. Outcome measures included the Beck Depression Inventory Scale 2nd edition-Fast Screen (BDI-FS), Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire Self-Reported (CRQ-SR), and Dyspnea Visual Analog Scale (VAS). Results showed improvement in symptoms of depression (LS mean -0.2) in the music therapy group with statistical divergence between groups (p = 0.007). The CRQ-SR demonstrated improvement in dyspnea (p = 0.01 LS mean 0.5) and mastery (p = 0.06 LS mean 0.5) in the music therapy group and fatigue (p = 0.01 LS mean 0.3). VAS demonstrated highly significant effect in the music therapy group between weeks 5 and 6 (p < 0.001). The findings of this study suggest that music therapy combined with standard PR may prove to be an effective modality in the management of pulmonary disease."

Musical training and music-based rehabilitation have been shown to enhance cognitive functioning and neuroplasticity, but the potential rehabilitative effects of music in TBI are still largely unknown. The aim of the present crossover randomized controlled trial (RCT) was to determine the clinical efficacy of music therapy on cognitive functioning in TBI and to explore its neural basis. Using an AB\/BA design, 40 patients with moderate or severe TBI were randomized to receive a 3-month neurological music therapy intervention either during the first (AB, n = 20) or second (BA, n = 20) half of a 6-month follow-up period. Neuropsychological and motor testing and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were performed at baseline and at the 3-month and 6-month stage. Thirty-nine subjects who participated in baseline measurement were included in an intention-to-treat analysis using multiple imputation. Results showed that general EF (as indicated by the Frontal Assessment Battery [FAB]) and set shifting improved more in the AB group than in the BA group over the first 3-month period and the effect on general EF was maintained in the 6-month follow-up. Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analysis of the structural MRI data indicated that gray matter volume (GMV) in the right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) increased significantly in both groups during the intervention versus control period, which also correlated with cognitive improvement in set shifting. These findings suggest that neurological music therapy enhances EF and induces fine-grained neuroanatomical changes in prefrontal areas."

Methods: Sixty patients were selected through convenience sampling and were then randomly assigned to the intervention group and control group. In the intervention group and for 6 consecutive days, the patients received a combination of music and auditory stimulation twice a day for 15 minutes. The patients' physiological parameters were measured before the intervention, and then 10 minutes and finally 30 minutes after the intervention. The data were analyzed using multilevel modeling method through MLwiN version 2.27. Results: The results showed that there was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of demographic factors and the duration of coma. However, the results of the two-level multiple linear models which were performed for 6 consecutive days indicated a significant decrease in systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, respiratory rate and heart rate for the patients in the intervention group as compared to the patients in the control group (P < 0.0001). Nevertheless, no significant difference was observed in temperature and oxygen saturation (P > 0.05). Conclusion: Integration of music therapy with family recollection can moderate physiological parameters. Therefore, it is recommended to use this cost-effective treatment along with the routine treatments, especially for patients with traumatic brain injury."

Neurological music therapy may aid these aspects of recovery. We performed a cross-over randomized controlled trial where 40 persons with moderate-severe TBI received a 3-month neurological music therapy intervention (2 times\/week, 60 min\/session), either during the first (AB, n = 20) or second (BA, n = 20) half of a 6-month follow-up period. The evidence from this RCT previously demonstrated that music therapy enhanced general EF and set shifting. In the current study, outcome was assessed with self-report and caregiver-report questionnaires performed at baseline, 3-month, 6-month, and 18-month stages. The results showed that the self-reported Behavioural Regulation Index of the Behaviour Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF-A) improved more in the AB than BA group from baseline to 3-month stage and the effect was maintained in the 6-month follow-up. No changes in mood or quality of life questionnaires were observed. However, a qualitative content analysis of the feedback revealed that many participants experienced the intervention as helpful in terms of emotional well-being and activity. Our results suggest that music therapy has a positive effect on everyday behavioural regulation skills after TBI."

        "Abstract":"There is a growing body of research examining the potential benefits of music therapy-based auditory stimulation (MT) for individuals with movement disorders in improving gait performance. However, there is limited knowledge about the effects of MT on gait outcomes in individuals with traumatic brain injury (TBI) or spinal cord injury (SCI). A previous review of MT's impact on gait in TBI had limitations, and there are no studies on its effects on gait in SCI. In this study, we conducted a meta-analysis to more thoroughly evaluate the impact of MT on gait outcomes in individuals with TBI and SCI. We systematically searched through eight databases and found six studies on MT in TBI and four on SCI. Our meta-analysis showed that MT has positive medium effect improvements on spatiotemporal aspects of gait in individuals with TBI (Hedge's g: 0.52) and SCI (0.53). These findings suggest that MT could be a practical intervention for enhancing different aspects of gait in these populations, although the limited number and \"fair\" quality of the studies included in the meta-analysis may affect the generalizability of the outcomes. Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms by which MT may influence gait and determine the optimal parameters for its use."

Our purpose is to investigate the effects of a novel rehabilitative approach combining robotic verticalization training (RVT) with personalized music stimulation in people with DoC. Methods: Sixteen subjects affected by minimally conscious state due to traumatic brain lesions who attended our Intensive Neuro-Rehabilitation Unit were enrolled in this randomized trial. They received either music robotic verticalization (MRV) using the Erigo device plus a personalized music playlist or only RVT without music stimuli. Each treatment was performed 2 times a week for 8 consecutive weeks in addition to standard neurorehabilitation. Results: We found significant improvements in all patients’ outcomes in the experimental group (who received MRV): Coma Recovery Scale-Revised (CRS-R) (p < 0.01), Level of Cognitive Functioning (LCF) (p < 0.02), Functional Independence Measure (FIM) (p < 0.03), Functional Communication Scale (FCS) (p < 0.007), Trunk Control Test (TCT) (p = 0.05). Significant differences between the two groups were also found in the main outcome measure CRS-R (p < 0.01) but not for TCT and FIM. Conclusions: Our study supports the safety and effectiveness of RVT with the Erigo device in chronic MCS, and the achievement of better outcomes when RVT is combined with music stimulation."

Objective: To evaluate the effect of music therapy on mood, anxiety and depression in institutionalised patients with traumatic brain injury. Study methodology: A prospective, observational study. Materials and methods: Thirteen patients with traumatic brain injury were included in the present study and took part in individual, weekly, 1-hour music therapy sessions over a period of 20 weeks. Each session was divided into two 30-minute periods - one devoted to listening to music (receptive music therapy) and the other to playing an instrument (active music therapy). The assessment criteria (measured at weeks 1, 5, 10, 15 and 20) were mood (on the face scale) and anxiety-depression (on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression [HAD] Scale). Mood was assessed immediately before and after the first music therapy session and every fifth session. Results: Music therapy enabled a significant improvement in mood, from the first session onwards. This short-term effect was confirmed by the immediate changes in the scores after music therapy sessions (from 4.6+\/-3.2 to 2.6+\/-2; p<0.01). Music therapy also led to a significant reduction in anxiety-depression (p<0.05) from week 10 onwards and up until the end of the study (week 20). Conclusion: These results confirm the usefulness of music therapy in the treatment of anxiety-depression and mood in patients with traumatic brain injury. Music therapy could usefully form an integral part of the management programme for these patients."

This condition encourages development of a non-pharmacological therapy to complement pharmacological therapy, such as progressive muscle relaxation and music therapy (RESIK). The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of RESIK on blood pressure among older adults with hypertension in Depok Indonesia. Methods: This study used quasi experimental design with pre and post test with control group approach. One-hundred older adults with hypertension were divided into two groups using stratified random sampling and purposive sampling. Result: After 11 sessions of RESIK therapy in 6 days, the paired t-test showed a decrease in systolic blood pressure to 29.2 mmHg and a decrease in diastolic blood pressure to 16.2 mmHg. Conclusion: In conclusion, RESIK decreased systolic blood pressure p < 0,001, but it did not significantly decrease diastolic blood pressure p > 0.167. It is recommended that RESIK be used regularly for an older adult population with hypertension."

        "Abstract":"Background: High blood pressure, anxiety, depression and sleep disorder is very common in patients with hypertension. We aimed to perform a meta-analysis to evaluate the effects of adjuvant music therapy for patients with hypertension, to provide insights to the clinical management of hypertension. Methods: Two authors searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, China Biomedical Literature Database, Wanfang Databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the role of music therapy in hypertension up to Oct 15, 2022. RevMan 5.3 software was used for meta-analysis. Results: A total of 20 RCTs including 2306 patients were finally included. 1154 patients received music therapy. Meta-analysis showed that music therapy can effectively reduce the systolic blood pressure(MD = - 9.00, 95%CI: - 11.99~- 6.00), diastolic blood pressure(MD = -6.53, 95%CI: -9.12~- 3.93), heart rate (MD = -3.76, 95%CI: -7.32~- 0.20), self-rating anxiety scale (SAS) score(MD =-8.55, 95%CI: -12.04~-4.12), self-rating depression scale (SDS) score(MD = -9.17, 95%CI: -13.85~-5.18), Hamilton anxiety scale (HAMA), score(MD = -3.37, 95%CI: - 5.38~- 1.36), PSQI score(MD =-1.61, 95%CI:-2.30~- 0.93) compared with routine therapy in patients with hypertension(all P < 0.05). No publication bias in the synthesized outcomes were found (all P > 0.05). Conclusion: Music therapy can effectively control blood pressure and heart rate, reduce anxiety and depression levels, and improve sleep quality in hypertensive patients. Limited by the quantity and quality of included studies, the above conclusions need to be verified by more high-quality studies."

        "Abstract":"Background: From epidemiologic data, half of hypertensive patients did not achieve the target blood pressure with pharmacotherapy, partly due to poor compliance. Music therapy is an adjunctive therapy which was proved effective for blood pressure reduction. We aimed to investigate the effect of Thai instrumental folk music listening on blood pressure in Thai hypertensive patients. Design, setting and subjects: A randomized controlled trial, conducted in the stage-2 hypertensive patients at Srinagarind Hospital, Khon Kaen, Thailand. Methods: One hundred-twenty participants were randomized to music listening group and control group (1:1). The music listening group was assigned to listen to Thai instrumental folk music once a day for one month. Outcome measures: The primary and secondary outcome measures were home blood pressure (Day 0th and 30th) and office blood pressure (Day 0th and 120th), respectively. Results: Home systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) in the music listening group were significantly reduced compared with baseline (-9.5 ± 7.1 mmHg (95%CI -11.43, -7.64) and -6.1 ± 5.7 mmHg (95%CI -7.51, -4.53), respectively). Both home SBP and DBP at day 30th of the music listening group were significantly lower than in the control group (-6.0 mmHg (95%CI -8.58, -3.40) and -3.15 mmHg (95%CI -5.20, -1.09), respectively), while the differences of office SBP and DBP between two groups were not significant. Conclusion: This study demonstrated that Thai instrumental folk music listening was effective for SBP and DBP reduction in stage-2 HT patients. This therapy can be used as an alternating approach simultaneously with pharmacological treatment. This trial was registered retrospectively after completion to ClinicalTrials.gov registration number: NCT03381820."

Listening to music during hemodialysis treatments positively affects patients' hemodynamics, laboratory values, quality of life, and physical symptoms. The effect of live singing during hemodialysis treatments, however, has not previously been studied. Methods: A total of 24 participants with a diagnosis of end-stage kidney disease participated in the study. The vocalist was a musically trained dialysis nurse. Twelve of the patients listened to 15 min of live singing during 6 consecutive hemodialysis sessions, while the other 12 underwent standard hemodialysis. After a washout period of 2 days, the two groups were reversed. Results: Listening to live music was associated with improvements in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, better quality of sleep, fewer cramps, and reduced anxiety\/depression, pain, and itching ( p < .05, all values). Conclusions: Listening to live music during hemodialysis is an effective and potentially low-cost therapy for the dialysis care team to employ during hemodialysis treatments."

        "Abstract":"Background: Music therapy has been applied in hemodialysis (HD) patients for relieving mental stress. Whether the stress-relieving effect by music therapy is predictive of clinical outcome in HD patients is still unclear. Methods: We recruited a convenience sample of 99 patients on maintenance HD and randomly assigned them to the experimental (n=49) or control (n=50) group. The experimental group received relaxing music therapy for 1 week, whereas the control group received no music therapy. In the experimental group, we compared cardiovascular mortality in the patients with and without cortisol changes. Results: The salivary cortisol level was lowered after 1 week of music therapy in the experimental group (-2.41±3.08 vs 1.66±2.11 pg\/mL, P<0.05), as well as the frequency of the adverse reaction score (-3.35±5.76 vs -0.81±4.59, P<0.05), the severity of adverse reactions score (-1.93±2.73 vs 0.33±2.71, P<0.05), and hemodialysis stressor scale (HSS) score (-6.00±4.68 vs -0.877±7.08, P<0.05). The difference in salivary cortisol correlated positively with HD stress score scales (r=0.231, P<0.05), systolic blood pressure (r=0.264, P<0.05), and respiratory rates (r=0.369, P<0.05) and negatively with finger temperature (r=-0.235, P<0.05) in the total study population. The 5-year cardiovascular survival in the experimental group was higher in patients whose salivary cortisol lowered by <0.6 pg\/mL than that in patients whose salivary cortisol lowered by >0.6 pg\/mL (83.8% vs 63.6%, P<0.05). Conclusion: Providing music during HD is an effective complementary therapy to relieve the frequency and severity of adverse reactions, as well as to lower salivary cortisol levels. Differences in salivary cortisol after music therapy may predict cardiovascular mortality in patients under maintenance HD."

        "Abstract":"Introduction: The sources of stress involved in chronic kidney disease (CKD) can lead to depressive states, directly affecting the hemodialysis patient's quality of life (QOL). There are few reports and studies on therapeutic interventions that aim to minimize depressive symptoms in these patients and an even greater shortage of studies using music therapy. Objective: This study evaluated the effect of music therapy on QOL and depressive symptoms in hemodialysis patients. Method: This was a music therapy intervention study in which 23 patients were evaluated regarding QOL and depression symptoms at two distinct stages - before and after the intervention. Eight sessions of music therapy were conducted, with two weekly sessions and an average duration of 75 minutes. The intervention was conducted by the music therapist herself, using specific music therapy techniques, besides voice and guitar to conduct harmonic and rhythmic support for the groups' sound-music production. Results: The patients showed a significant reduction in depression symptoms (p < 0.001) and better QOL results, with significant differences in the following dimensions: functional capacity (p = 0.011), pain (p = 0.036), general health (p = 0.01), vitality (p = 0.004), mental health (p = 0.012), symptom and problem list (p = 0.01), and overall health (p = 0.01). Conclusions: Intervention with music therapy constitutes an effective option in the treatment and prevention of depressive symptoms and improved QOL of HD patients."

        "Abstract":"This study aimed to analyze the influence of patient-selected music listening on the pain and anxiety levels of hemodialysis patients after undergoing a vascular access operation. Methods: Sixty five patients were randomly assigned to the experimental group (n = 32) or the control group (n = 33). The experimental group was instructed to listen to their favorite music using headphones during their operations at the center. The control group underwent the operations without listening to any music. The pain measurement during vascular access operation was measured by subjective pain and objective pain behavior; anxiety was measured by subjective anxiety and anxiety states. Results: The experimental group reported significantly lower subjective pain levels than the control group (t = 9.36, p = 0.003). Regarding objective pain behaviors, the experimental group had a significantly lower score than the control group (t = 4.59, p = 0.036). The experimental group had significantly lowered subjective anxiety compared to the control group (F = 10.10, p = 0.002). Regarding anxiety states, the experimental group had significantly lower scores than the control group (F = 23.34, p < 0.001). Conclusion: The results suggest that patient-selected music listening reduced hemodialysis patients' pain and anxiety levels during vascular access operations. Therefore, music medicine can be included as a new clinical intervention."

However, the effect of music therapy on pain relief in hemodialysis patients still remains unclear. Methods: Electronic databases were comprehensively searched through MEDLINE, Web of Science, EMBASE, Cochrane, and WANFANG. All studies met inclusion criteria were eligible for systematic review and meta-analysis. Clinical variables were extracted and pooled results were obtained using STATA software. Results: A total of 10 studies with 722 participants were included for systematic review. Overall, music therapy showed a significantly favorable effect on reducing pain for patients undergoing hemodialysis (SMD: -0.90, 95%CIs: -1.25 to -0.55, P < .001). No publication bias was observed. Conclusions: Music-based interventions could significantly relieve pain for patients undergoing hemodialysis, which should be promoted as an effective and safe complementary method."

        "Abstract":"Objective: Patients with high dose chemotherapy (HDC) with autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) are highly distressed. Psycho-oncological support might be beneficial but is not routinely provided. Our aim was to investigate whether music therapy (MT) in addition to standard supportive treatment had any effect on quality of life, depression, anxiety, side effects of therapy, medication, and immunological changes during and within three months after HDC plus ASCT. Methods: Patients (n = 66) with HDC plus ASCT were randomly assigned to either MT (Intervention Group = IG) or standard supportive treatment (Control Group = CG). Quality of life was measured by EORTC QLQ-C30. Depression and anxiety were measured by the HADS-D before transplantation, during and after the inpatient stay. In addition, adverse events (AE), medication, and immunological parameters were observed. Results: There was no improvement of global quality of life for patients receiving additional MT, but their perception of pain significantly changed (p = 0.027). Patients were neither depressed nor anxious on admission, therefore no improvements were found. IG patients had less 3-4° toxicities (e.g., mucositis). Aprepitant for antiemetic therapy was administered significantly more often in the CG (p = 0.040). The IgA decline and T4 count was less in IG, T8, and NK count decreased most in IG. These findings failed significance. Conclusions: MT may improve pain perception in patients receiving HDC plus ASCT. Additionally positive effects on toxicities, use of antiemetic medication, and immunological changes were observed. As some of these findings failed significance, studies with larger sample sizes are needed. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."

Patients with cancer have been hugely encouraged in recent years to use complementary medicine to relieve chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. The present study was conducted to determine the effect of music and periorbital massage therapy on chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in patients with gastrointestinal cancers. Methods: The present single-blind clinical trial study was conducted on 60 patients with gastrointestinal cancer undergoing chemotherapy who were randomly assigned to control and music plus massage therapy groups. Two interventions were concurrently carried out on patients in music plus massage therapy group while receiving chemotherapy medication, but the control group received no intervention. Rhodes questionnaire was used to assess nausea and vomiting before and 24 hours after chemotherapy. Data were analyzed using descriptive and analytical statistical tests (Chi-square and t-tests). Results: Music plus periorbital massage therapy significantly reduced nausea and vomiting in patients undergoing chemotherapy compared to the control group. Conclusion: According to the results, using music plus periorbital massage improves nausea and vomiting in patients undergoing chemotherapy, and can be considered as a complementary medicine method in conjunction with other medicinal therapies to relieve symptoms of patients with cancer."

Design: Quantitative, descriptive, longitudinal approach. Setting: A comprehensive cancer hospital and a university in southern Florida. Sample: 15 women with a diagnosis of breast cancer, stages I-III, receiving adjuvant chemotherapy. Methods: Participants individually received MBMT for one hour per week for four weeks. The sessions consisted of varied music activities accompanied by mindfulness attitudes, or mental strategies that enhance moment-to-moment awareness, and weekly homework. Demographic information was collected at baseline. Main research variables: Attention was measured using Conners' Continuous Performance Test II. Mood was measured using the Profile of Mood States-Brief Form. Narrative comments collected from the homework assignments served to reinforce quantitative data. Findings: Repeated measures analysis of variance showed that attention improved significantly over time. Although all mood states significantly improved from the beginning to the end of each MBMT session, the mood state of fatigue decreased significantly more than the other mood states. Conclusions: MBMT enhances attention and mood, particularly the mood state of fatigue, in women with breast cancer receiving adjuvant chemotherapy. . Implications for nursing: A preferred music listening and mindfulness exercise may be offered to women with breast cancer who experience attention problems and mood distress."

        "Abstract":"Context: Eighty-seven patients newly diagnosed with lung, breast, or gastrointestinal cancer and undergoing chemotherapy in the infusion suite of a large urban hospital in New York City. Objective: Patients were enrolled in this study of music therapy's impact on resilience in coping with the impact of symptoms inclusive of symptom clustering. Methods: Patients were randomly assigned to three arms: clinical instrumental improvisation or clinical vocal improvisation 43 subjects to instrumental improvisation or vocal improvisation and 44 subjects to control. All subjects received a Medical Music Psychotherapy Assessment including psychosocial information and music preferences, pre-\/post-Resilience Scale, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Visual Analogue Scale\/Faces Scale, and a pain-Color Analysis Scale. Interventions included 20-minute music therapy (MT) and two additional sessions. Results: Significant increases in Resilience Scale in MT groups after treatment with instrumental and vocal MT interventions equally potent-reflect average changes of 3.4 and 4.83 (P = 0.625), respectively. Although Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale scores showed little impact of MT on perceived anxiety\/depression, a strong correlation is seen between vocal intervention and lower depression scores through Visual Analogue Scale-rendered postsessions. This yielded a significant decrease in pain levels immediately after MT, with the final session showing the most significant change in pain level. Resilience in enduring procedures is a necessary component of combating potential negative illness perception. Conclusion: Our study shows MT's facility to propel resilience in patients newly diagnosed with cancer, particularly when promoting and pairing adaptation toward coping through the expression of perceived negative effects of emotional and physiological symptoms."

Background: Behavioural techniques such as music therapy and visual imagery are becoming increasingly important in dealing with chemotherapy-induced anxiety, nausea and vomiting. Design: The study is an experimental and cross-sectional one and performed on a single sample group with the pre-post-test design consisting of 40 individuals. The individuals in the sample group comprised both the control and the case group of the study. Methods: To obtain the study data, the following forms were used: the Personal Information Form, Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, The Visual Analogue Scale and Individual Evaluation Form for Nausea and Vomiting adapted from The Morrow Assessment of Nausea and Vomiting. Results: In the study, the participants' state and trait anxiety levels decreased significantly (p < 0·05). Music therapy and visual imagery reduced the severity and duration of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting significantly (p < 0·05). In our research, 40% of the patients did not have anticipatory nausea and 55% of the patients did not have anticipatory vomiting during the third chemotherapy cycle during which music therapy and guided visual imagery were implemented. Conclusions: It was determined that complementary approaches comprising music therapy and visual imagery had positive effects on chemotherapy-induced anxiety, nausea and vomiting, which are suffered too often and affect the patients' whole lives adversely. Relevance to clinical practice: This study is worthy of interest as it has revealed that music therapy and visual imagery which have been proven to be effective in many health problems in different areas are also important, and practical complementary approaches that are effective in getting chemotherapy-induced anxiety, nausea and vomiting under control."

        "Abstract":"Background: Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) is the most common and severe side effects brought by chemotherapeutics. The role of music interventions in relieving CINV is uncertain. The aim of this systematic review was to test the effects of music interventions on three categories of CINV. Methods: A systematic search was conducted in Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), PubMed, EMBASE, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), WanFang, and Chinese Biomedical Database (CBM) in order to capture randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the comparative efficacy of music interventions and others. Two investigators screened, sorted, and extracted the data, and appraised the risk of bias. All statistical analyses were performed using RevMan 5.3 software. Results: The literature search yielded 608 studies of which only ten RCTs fulfilled the eligibility criteria with 632 patients retrieved. Although the duration, the frequency of interventions, and the type of selected music varied across studies, commonly used elements included music listening. Results showed that music interventions were associated with reducing the incidence of anticipatory CINV and lowering the severity of delayed vomiting (MD = - 0.65, 95% CI = - 1.08 to - 0.23). However, strongly controversial results existed in terms of reducing the incidence of acute and delayed CINV, the severity of acute CINV, the severity of delayed nausea, and improving patients' quality of life. Conclusions: Music interventions may effectively reduce the incidence of anticipatory CINV and relieve the severity of delayed vomiting in patients with chemotherapy based on limited data. However, the conclusion should be interpreted with caution and further research is required to design with large-scale and rigorous methods."

        "Abstract":"Primary fibromyalgia, a poorly understood chronic pain syndrome, is a disorder of uncertain etiology. The ultimate goal of fibromyalgia treatment is to develop a multimodal therapy. In recent years, the use of music as an intervention for the pain management and other symptoms has increased. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of music on pain and depression for people diagnosed with fibromyalgia using Rogers' theory of the unitary human being as the theoretical framework. An experimental 4-week longitudinal trial design was undertaken. Sixty patients diagnosed with fibromyalgia were randomly assigned to either a music intervention group or a control group. Music interventions consisted of listening to music once a day for 4 consecutive weeks using two types of CDs. Pain was measured with the McGill Pain Questionnaire Long Form and depression with the Beck inventory; a 100-mm visual analog scale was used to measure pain and depression. The treatment group reported a significant reduction in pain and depression at week 4 compared with the control group. Members of the control group reported no differences in pain. The findings of this pilot study suggest the importance of music therapy as a nursing intervention and justify further investigation into music as a self-management intervention to reduce pain and depression."

        "Abstract":"Objective: We evaluated the effects of music therapy on pain, depression and quality of life in patients with fibromyalgia. Methods: Ten online databases were searched to identify randomized controlled trials that investigated the effects of music therapy on fibromyalgia patients, published up to 1st January 2019. The results were filtered and independently extracted. Statistical heterogeneity was assessed using the chi-square test. According to the outcome of the heterogeneity indices, either a fixed effect or a random effect model was used. Results: In total, seven randomized controlled trials were included. The Pain Visual Analog Scale, the McGill Pain Scale, the Beck Depression Scale and the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire were used as outcome measures. Our evidence indicated that patient intervention with music therapy had lower scores on the Pain Visual Analog Scale (95% confidence interval [CI] -2.22 to -1.18, Z = 6.44, P < 0.00001, four studies) and Beck Depression Scale (95% CI -0.65 to -0.03, Z = 2.17, P = 0.03, two studies). No significant differences were observed on the McGill Pain Scale between the music intervention and control groups (95% CI -0.83 to -0.09, Z = 1.59, P = 0.11). A general qualitative description of the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire results was given due to high heterogeneity (I2 = 96%, P < 0.00001). Conclusions: The music therapy is superior to non-music therapy in the treatment of pain, depression, and improvement of quality of life in fibromyalgia patients. However, due to the low quantity and quality of the included studies, a larger number and high-quality of RCTs are needed to confirm the beneficial effects of music therapy."

It constitutes a significant health problem because of its prevalence and economic impact. The aim of the present study was to determine the therapeutic benefits of low impact aerobic exercise alone or in combination with music therapy in patients with fibromyalgia. Methods: A single-blind randomized controlled pilot trial was performed. Thirty-five individuals with fibromyalgia were divided into three groups: (G1) therapeutic aerobic exercise with music therapy (n=13); (G2) therapeutic aerobic exercise at any rhythm (n=13) and (CG) control (n=9). The intervention period lasted eight weeks. Depression, quality of life, general discomfort and balance were assessed before and after intervention. Results: At post-intervention, group G1 improved in all variables (depression (p=0.002), quality of life (p=0.017), general discomfort (p=0.001), and balance (p=0.000)), while group G2 improved in general discomfort (p=0.002). The change observed in balance was statistically different between groups (p=0.01). Conclusion: Therapeutic aerobic exercise is effective in improving depression and general discomfort in individuals with fibromyalgia. However, effectiveness is higher when combined with music therapy, which brings about further improvements in quality of life and balance."

The aim of the investigation was to determine the effects of music on pain in fibromyalgia patients. This randomized clinical trial was carried out with 37 fibromyalgia outpatients as an experimental group (n = 21) and control group (n = 16) at a University Hospital Internal Medicine and Rheumatology Clinic between 1 June and 1 December 2014. The research instruments used were descriptive characteristics questionnaire, Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), music CD which includes water and wave sounds recommended by the Turkish Psychological Association for psychological relaxation, and pain evaluation form. According to the findings, the average age of patients was 43.59 years ± 10.30, 94.6 % were women and 81.1 % were married. The fibromyalgia patients had the disease ranged from 1 month to 20 years, the average of disease duration was 23.6 ± 45.5 months, and the average of pain intensity was 6.89 ± 1.64 on the VAS. Average pain was reported in the experimental group in VAS on day 1 (5.45 ± 2.73), day 7 (4.57 ± 2.71), and day 14 (4.14 ± 2.45), and significant reduction in pain in the listening music group was seen (p = 0.026). A repeated measure analysis of variance controlling for differences between days demonstrated a significant decrease in pain between day 1 and day 14 (p = 0.022). There was no significant decrease in pain among control group participants. The effect of music has been found to control pain in fibromyalgia patients. Music therapy should be suggested in pain management for fibromyalgia patients as an non-pharmacologic nursing intervention."

In the literature, it was shown that these interventions managed pain conditions as well as reduced complaints, increased relaxation, and improved moods. Objective: This study aimed at evaluating music therapy, in the form of therapeutic music listening, specifically for patients with fibromyalgia, to treat chronic pain by reducing pain perception, increasing well-being, and improving quality of life. Methods: Twenty-four patients with fibromyalgia were recruited to take part in this feasibility pilot study that adopted a between-subject and within-subject design. Participants were randomised into three groups: (1) standard care, (2) standard care plus preferred music listening, (3) standard care plus Melomics-Health music listening, composed by an algorithm. Participants in experimental groups listened to 30 min of music at home, twice a day for a month. Patients' perceptions of changes following the listening, the intensity of pain and its interference in their lives, physical and mental well-being, and reported attitudes towards listening to music were evaluated respectively through the patients' global impression of change, the brief pain inventory, the Short Form Healthy Survey-12, and the cognitive behavioural assessment-outcome evaluation. Results: The study showed that music listening can significantly affect mental well-being compared to no music. Moreover, the effects in the Melomics-Health group are maintained at follow-up. No significant effect on pain perception was noted. Conclusions: The study provides information supporting a possible role of music listening in improving well-being of patients with fibromyalgia."

Thirty-two patients were randomly assigned to either an experimental group who listened to music during the colonoscopy or a standard procedure no music control group. Before and after the procedure, subjects completed the State Anxiety Inventory. Physiological signs of anxiety, including heart rate and blood pressure, were monitored at four time points during the procedure. Repeated measures analysis of variance indicated a significant group by time interaction on the physiological signs of anxiety. Post hoc analysis indicated that heart rate and systolic and diastolic blood pressure significantly decreased among the music intervention group during the procedure while remaining unchanged in the control group. No significant effect of the treatment was observed on the State Anxiety Inventory, although a trend indicated that the music intervention decreased state anxiety. Finally, the group who received the music intervention required less physician-administered sedation during the procedure than did the control group. These findings indicate that music therapy has the potential to reduce physiological indicators of anxiety and the need for sedation among individuals undergoing a colonoscopy."

These procedures are sometimes disturbing and painful for the patient. In gastrointestinal suits, endoscopy and colonoscopy may be performed on awake or sedated patients. Music therapy is a common and non-pharmacological treatment for various medical conditions, pain, and anxiety. The aim of the present study was to add music therapy to sedation administered during endoscopy and colonoscopy. The effect of music treatment on drug consumption, anxiety, and pain was investigated. Materials and methods: American Anesthesiologist Association I-III adult patients scheduled for endo\/colonoscopy were randomized to music treatment and no music treatment groups. Patients with endoscopic ultrasound and endoscopic retrograde colangiopancreaticography were excluded from the study. Anxiety score and pain severity were evaluated before and after the procedure. Heart rate, mean arterial pressure, and oxygen saturation were recorded before, during, and after the procedure. Total drug consumption was recorded. Patient satisfaction and desire for the same protocol for recurrent procedures were investigated. Results: Music therapy added to deep sedation administered by anesthesiologists provided decreased anxiety score and propofol consumption. Patient satisfaction was increased, and patients reported a desire for the same protocol for recurrent procedures. Conclusion: The present study may serve as the beginning of using music therapy for pain treatment in gastroenterology procedures in our hospital with\/without sedation. Music and other non-pharmacological treatment methods must be remembered to increase patient comfort during enco\/colonoscopies and other painful procedures."

A dyspnea reduction was observed in women in both the groups (p < .001) and in men in the music therapy group only (p = .001). A change in the value of anxiety (6.43, SD = 7.73) on the 10th day compared with the first day of the study was noticed (p < .001). However, this change was not influenced by the type of rehabilitation, gender, or a combination of these two variables (p > .05).

Nursing interventions using music therapy or sensory information among patients with coronary artery disease has resulted in anxiety reduction, though results in Chinese subjects has not previously been published. Aims: To determine the effects of using nursing interventions of music therapy or sensory information, on reducing anxiety and uncertainty, and improving negative mood among Chinese subjects immediately prior to cardiac catheterization. Methods: An experimental three-group repeated measures design for this pilot study was used. Forty-five hospitalized adults (15\/group) undergoing cardiac catheterization were randomly assigned to either (1) a music therapy intervention, (2) a sensory information intervention or (3) treatment as usual (control). Anxiety, uncertainty and mood state were measured using self-reported questionnaires and physiological measures were made at baseline, post-intervention to determine their effect and post-cardiac catheterization to determine whether these interventions had any long-lasting effect. Results: The control group was found to be significantly older (P=0.001) than the two experimental groups. Older age was associated with lower anxiety scores (r=-0.31, P=0.04 at baseline; r=-0.30, P=0.04 post-intervention; r=-0.22, P=0.15 post-cardiac catheterization). After controlling for age, the use of music therapy or sensory information did not significantly reduce anxiety, improve mood state, reduce uncertainty, decrease heart or respiratory rate among subjects undergoing cardiac catheterization. Conclusion: The non-significant result may have been affected by the small sample, and the social and cultural expectations regarding the public display of emotions among Chinese populations."

Methods: In a quasi-experimental, pretest-posttest design, 101 subjects were randomly assigned to either the test group: those who listened to 20 minutes of preselected music, or the control group: those who received treatment as usual. Subject anxiety levels and physiological values were measured while waiting their turn for cardiac catheterization and just prior to departure to the cardiac lab. Results: 63 males and 38 females participated in the study. There was a statistically significant reduction in anxiety in the test group alone (P = 0.003) and in comparing the test to the control group (P = 0.004). In comparing the initial and departure physiologic values, it was noted that both heart rate and systolic blood pressure dropped in the test group, but increased in the control group. Within gender groups, there were no statistically significant differences in hemodynamics or STAI scores, but between gender groups there were significantly higher diastolic blood pressure in males and STAI initial and departure scores for females. Discussion: Patients waiting for their cardiac catheterization benefit from music therapy. Anxiety and the heightened physiological values elicited by the stress response are reduced. Results also suggest that women waiting for cardiac catheterization experience a higher level of anxiety than males."

Objective: An innovative study using music therapy (Bonny Method of Guided Imagery and Music [BMGIM]) explored the experiences of cardiac rehabilitation participants in an outpatient setting at 2 major metropolitan teaching hospitals. Methods: Commencing 6 to 15 weeks after cardiothoracic surgery, 6 study participants were recruited for 6 weekly music therapy (BMGIM) sessions. Qualitative analysis of the patient narrative within a semiotic framework demonstrated that patients used music therapy to spontaneously explore their recovery process. Results: Five grand themes emerged: (1) looking through the frame, (2) feeling the impact, (3) spiralling into the unexpected, (4) sublime plateau, and (5) rehearsing new steps. The themes related to physical changes, adjustment after surgery, and anticipated lifestyle. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that music therapy (BMGIM) may be used to access and understand the internal recovery process of postcardiothoracic surgical patients, providing an additional clinical tool to augment the external rehabilitation process."

        "Abstract":"Background: Intracardiac catheterization is a routine physical examination. Due to psychological strains, several psychosocial interventions, including music therapy, have been proposed. The aim of the present study was to examine whether the preventive or adjuvant use of music therapy results in a reduction in both subjective and objective anxiety and thus leads to a reduction in sedative medication. METHODS OF ASSESSMENT: N=83 patients (48 male, 35 female, 66+\/-11 yrs) waiting for scheduled cardiac catheterization were randomly allocated to one of three groups: control group (standard care), exposure group (music stimulation during the procedure), or coaching group (additional music therapeutic coaching). Target variables were subjective anxiety and physiological parameters. Results: Music intervention did effectively reduce subjective anxiety (STAI-S reduction pre-post: exposure 11 pt, coaching: 4 pt, control: 6 pt; p=0.033). Physiological values and medication did not differ between groups. Conclusion: The use of music stimulation during the catheterization has a relaxing and calming effect on patients. It seems to be especially beneficial in a subgroup of patients with higher-than-average psychological strains."

        "Abstract":"Background: Evidence of music therapy as an effective supportive therapy in invasive cardiac procedures is increasing, but more research is needed. Aims: To evaluate the impact of music therapy on stress responses during cardiac device lead extraction procedures performed in local anaesthesia. Methods: Sixty-four patients undergoing cardiac implantable electronic device lead extraction at Oslo University Hospital Ulleval from March 2018 to September 2019 were randomized to music therapy (n = 32) or control (n = 32). Primary endpoints were patient satisfaction with pain management and average pain intensity during the procedure. Secondary endpoints were average anxiety intensity, need for analgesic\/anxiolytic drugs, blood pressure, heart and respiration rate. Results: All patients in the music therapy group completed the intervention. Patient satisfaction with pain management was 10.00 (8.00, 10.00) in the music therapy vs. 10.00 (9.00, 10.00) in the control group (p = 0.85), and average level of pain 0.89 (0.22, 1.13) vs. 0.96 (0.36, 1.58), respectively (p = 0.38). Average anxiety score was 1.00 (0.33, 2.17) in the music therapy vs 1.67 (0.71, 3.35) in the control group (p = 0.056). The use of analgesic\/anxiolytic drugs and physiological parameters were similar across groups. Conclusions: In this study of music therapy during cardiac device lead extractions, no effect was found on patient satisfaction with pain management or average pain level. A decrease in patient anxiety of borderline significance was observed in the music therapy group. More studies with more sensitive measures of pain and anxiety are needed to determine the value of music therapy in invasive cardiac procedures."

        "Abstract":"Patients undergoing invasive cardiac catheterization (ICC) can experience anxiety and pain. A common practice in the United States is to administer benzodiazepines and opioids for conscious sedation to relieve these symptoms. Music may reduce anxiety and pain perception. We sought to evaluate the role of music in lieu of pharmacotherapy for conscious sedation during elective ICC. A retrospective data analysis was performed on patients who underwent ICC and received music therapy ± intravenous sedation\/analgesics based on patient's preference compared with control patients who were offered and received intravenous sedation\/analgesics based on patient's preference. A total of 161 patients were analyzed, 49 in the music arm, and 112 in the control arm. Baseline characteristics were similar in the 2 groups except that the rate of drug addiction, back pain, post-traumatic stress disorder, and hearing loss were higher in the control group when compared with the music arm. 42 (86%) of the patients in the music group and 29 (26%) of the control group received no sedation or analgesia in the periprocedural period. The average dose of midazolam (0.7 mg vs 0.1 mg, p <0.0001) and fentanyl (39.5 mcg vs 3 mcg, p <0.0001) was higher in the control than the music arm, respectively. 42 (86%) of patients receiving music therapy believed music was helpful in reducing their stress\/anxiety levels. In conclusion, music may serve as adjunctive\/alternative intervention to pharmacotherapy in relieving anxiety and stress for patients undergoing elective ICC."

Using a randomized, controlled trial with follow-up, the study was conducted in an outpatient cardiac rehabilitation program in Ohio. Sixty-eight of 103 recruited patients, 30 to 80 years of age, completed the protocol through posttreatment. Physiological and psychological outcomes were measured. Cardiac rehabilitation patients were randomly assigned to cardiac rehabilitation only or to music therapy plus cardiac rehabilitation. Music therapy included musical experiences, counseling, and Music-Assisted Relaxation and Imagery. The null hypothesis of no differences in health-related outcomes between cardiac rehabilitation patients who experienced cardiac rehabilitation with and without music therapy was rejected due to changes in systolic blood pressure pre to post-treatment. Interpretation of changes at 4 months posttreatment in anxiety, general health, and social functioning are limited, due to small sample sizes at follow-up. Pre to post-music therapy session improvements were also reported. Findings suggest that some health-related outcomes may be affected positively by participation in music therapy in addition to cardiac rehabilitation. Attrition contributed to limitations in statistical power."

Methods: The study design was a pre- and post-test randomised controlled trial that included 94 patients who underwent a transcatheter atrial septal defect closure. Patients were allocated to receive either music intervention (n = 47) or usual care (n = 47) during the interventional cardiac catheterisation. Music intervention effectiveness was examined in terms of anxiety, salivary cortisol level, and heart rate variability. Results: The average age of participants was 45.40 years (±16.04) in the experimental group and 47.26 years (±13.83) in the control group. Two-thirds (66.0%) of the participants in each group were women. State anxiety (F = 31.42, p < 0.001), anxiety-numerical rating scale (F = 20.08, p < 0.001), salivary cortisol levels (F = 4.98, p = 0.021), and low-frequency component\/high-frequency component ratio (F = 17.31, p < 0.001) in the experimental group were significantly reduced compared with those in the control group at the end of the music intervention. Conclusion: This study provides practical evidence of a reduction in anxiety and stress response from music intervention preceding an interventional cardiac catheterisation, indicating that this intervention should be considered in clinical management."

Results: In comparison to the control group, the experimental group, over time, demonstrated a statistically substantial decrease in pain, anxiety, systolic blood pressure, heart rate and respiratory rate (all P < 0.001), yet, there were no discernible variations (P > 0.05) in diastolic blood pressure. Conclusions: In conclusion, these results provide additional proof for using music therapy to minimize cardiac postoperative pain and anxiety, as well as systolic blood pressure, heart rate and respiratory rate. Moreover, it should be regarded as a supplementary treatment for pain and anxiety after cardiac valve replacement and other medical procedures with comparable postoperative pain."

        "Abstract":"Background. Music therapy has emerged as a promising evidence-based adjuvant method of intervention. This study aims to assess the effect of live oud music on physiological and psychological parameters in patients undergoing cardiac surgery, pre- and post-operatively. Methods. Twelve patients undergoing cardiac operations were randomly allocated into either intervention group or control group, six patients in each group. Patients in the intervention group listened to 20 minutes of improvised and personally customized live oud music before and after surgery while patients in the control group heard the normal hospital sounds. While anxiety scores were assessed preoperatively, vital signs and pain scores were assessed postoperatively together with serum levels of cortisol, which was used as a surrogate marker of the stress response. Results. In the intervention group, pain scores and respiratory rates showed statistically significant reduction after listening to music (P values of 0.043 and 0.034 respectively). Additionally, heart rates, anxiety scores and serum cortisol levels showed borderline significant reduction in patients who listened to music with P values, 0.063, 0.066 and 0.068 respectively. These changes were not found in the control group. Conclusions. This preliminary study suggests a role of live oud music therapy in decreasing stress response of the patients undergoing cardiac surgery, in addition to its positive effects on pain perception and anxiety scores."

Twenty-nine inpatients participated in this prospective, crossover randomized controlled trial. On two consecutive days, patients were randomized to receive music therapy services either on the first or second day of the study. On control days, they received no music. On music days, patients practiced music-based imagery (MBI), a form of music-assisted relaxation with patient-specific mental imagery before and after dressing changes. Also, on music days during dressing changes, the patients engaged in music alternate engagement (MAE), which consisted of active participation in music making. The dependent variables were the patients' subjective ratings of their pain and anxiety levels and the research nurse's objective ratings of their muscle tension levels. Two sets of data were collected before, three sets during, and another two sets after dressing changes. The results showed significant decrease in pain levels before (P < .025), during (P < .05), and after (P < .025) dressing changes on days the patients received music therapy in contrast to control days. Music therapy was also associated with a decrease in anxiety and muscle tension levels during the dressing changes (P < .05) followed by a reduction in muscle tension levels after dressing changes (P < .025). Music therapy significantly decreases the acute procedural pain, anxiety, and muscle tension levels associated with daily burn care."

        "Abstract":"Background: The treatment of burn patients is very challenging because burn injuries are one of the most severe traumas that can be experienced. The effect of music therapy on burn patients has been widely reported, but the results have been inconsistent. Thus, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials in burn patients to determine the effect of music during treatments. Methods: We searched a variety of electronic databases, including MEDLINE (via PubMed), EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Psychinfo, VIP Database for Chinese Technical Periodicals (VIP) and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) for relevant trials on the basis of predetermined eligibility criteria. from their first available date through February 2016. Our search focused on two key concepts: music interventions (including music, music therapy and music medicine) and physical activity outcomes (including pain, anxiety, burn characteristics, dressing changes, wound care, debridement and rehabilitation). Two reviewers independently screened records and extracted data from all eligible studies. Statistical heterogeneity was determined using Q-test and the I 2 statistic. The endpoints included standardized mean differences (SMDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Publication bias was tested by Begg's funnel plot and Egger's test. Results: A total of 17 studies met the inclusion criteria, for a total of 804 patients. A statistically significant difference in pain relief was demonstrated between music and non-music interventions (SMD = -1.26, 95% CI [-1.83, -0.68]), indicating that music intervention has a positive effect on pain alleviation for burn patients. The results indicated that music interventions markedly reduced anxiety in individuals compared to non-music interventions (SMD = -1.22, 95% CI [-1.75, -0.69]). Correspondingly, heart rate decreases were found after treatments that included music interventions (SMD = -0.60, 95% CI [-0.84, -0.36]). Conclusion: In summary, a positive correlation was found between treatments including music interventions and pain alleviation, anxiety relief, and heart rate reduction in burn patients. However, additional high-quality studies with carefully considered music interventions for burn patients are still needed."

Insufficient or unsuccessful pain management can negatively affect physiological, psychological, and social health in burn patients, both during and after hospitalization. Music therapy and music medicine interventions have been shown to positively affect pain and mental health in this population. This systematic review and meta-analysis provide an update of Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) using music therapy or music medicine interventions in adult burn patients. Methods: A variety of databases were searched from their beginning to June 2020, including PsycINFO and PsycArticles (via APAsycNET), PubMed and MEDLINE (via OvidSP), Scopus, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library. Data of all articles meeting the inclusion criteria were extracted, organized, and processed according to the PRISMA guidelines. Statistical analysis was performed using Q-test and I2 statistics. Results: 10 RCTs with a total of 1061 participants were included. The results of the meta-analysis showed a statistically significant reduction of pain (I2 = 96.03%, P < 0.001), anxiety (I2 = 98.85%, P < 0.002), and improved relaxation (I2 = 87.19%, P < 0.001) favoring music interventions compared to control groups. Conclusions: This review provides preliminary evidence for the effectiveness of music interventions for adult burn patients. However, more high-quality RCTs are needed to safely establish guidelines for music therapists and other health care professionals in using music for health purposes with this population."

        "Abstract":"Background: Burn injuries cause significant physical impairments that need comprehensive rehabilitation and coordination with the acute burn care team. Music had been shown to increase positive mood during exercise, which may result in motivation for participation in exercise programs. The current study aimed to evaluate the effect of physical therapy rehabilitation program combined with music therapy on children with lower limb burns. Methods: A twelve-week randomized controlled study including thirty pediatrics with lower limb burns. They were randomly assigned into two equal groups, 15 children per each. Group A received a physical therapy rehabilitation program combined with music therapy in addition to routine medical care. However, Group B received a physical therapy rehabilitation program without music therapy. Assessment of pain was by visual analogue scale (VAS), assessment of the range of motion (ROM) by goniometer, and gait assessed by GAIT Rite. The evaluation was carried before and after the interventions. Results: Before starting the study, no significant differences were detected between the two study groups (p < 0.05). The study results reported statistically significant improvement in VAS, ROM, and GAIT Rite in both groups after the intervention (p < 0.05). Group A showed greater improvement than group B in all outcome measures (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Physical therapy program combined with music therapy is an effective and safe modality for improving pain, range of motion, and gait parameters in pediatrics with lower limb burn. Also, physical therapy combined with music therapy is more effective than physical therapy alone in the treatment of pediatrics with lower limb burns."

However, live music (LM) delivered by professional music therapists is not common in developing countries owing to the shortage of professional music therapists. Thus, in this study, we explored the effects of a multidisciplinary collaborative intervention based on LM on physical and psychological well-being of adolescent and young adult (AYA) patients undergoing HSCT with a quasi-experimental design. Methods: A total of 62 AYA patients agreed to participate and were randomly assigned to the intervention group receiving 4-week LM therapy (n = 31) or control group receiving usual care (n = 31). Depression, salivary cortisol, fatigue, and quality of life were the main outcome indicators measured at baseline, immediately after the intervention, 1 month, and 3 months follow-up. The intervention effects were analyzed by generalized estimating equations. Results: Significant decrease in HADS-D scores occurred in the intervention group compared with wait-list controls at immediately after intervention (p < 0.05). Participants in the LM group had greater improvement in quality of life and lower salivary cortisol level than those in the wait-list control group at immediately, 1 month, and 3 months after intervention (p < 0.05). However, the interaction effects of the BFI scores were not significant. Conclusions: LM therapy significantly alleviated depression and salivary cortisol levels as well as improved quality of life of AYA patients undergoing HSCT."

The primary aims of the study were to determine feasibility\/acceptability of the AME intervention protocol and data collection in the context of HCST. Secondary aims were to examine caregivers' perceptions of the benefit of AME and whether there were changes in child and caregiver cortisol levels relative to the AME intervention. Results indicated that the AME could be implemented in this context and that data could be collected, though the collection of salivary cortisol may constitute an additional burden for families. Nevertheless, data that were collected suggest that families derive benefit from the AME, which underscores the need for devising innovative methods to understand the neurophysiological impacts of the AME."

Methods: This was a multisite randomized, controlled trial (COG-ANUR0631) conducted at 8 Children's Oncology Group sites involving 113 AYAs aged 11-24 years undergoing myeloablative HSCT. Participants, randomized to the TMV or low-dose control (audiobooks) group, completed 6 sessions over 3 weeks with a board-certified music therapist. Variables were based on Haase's Resilience in Illness Model (RIM). Participants completed measures related to latent variables of illness-related distress, social integration, spiritual perspective, family environment, coping, hope-derived meaning, and resilience at baseline (T1), postintervention (T2), and 100 days posttransplant (T3). Results: At T2, the TMV group reported significantly better courageous coping (Effect Size [ES], 0.505; P = .030). At T3, the TMV group reported significantly better social integration (ES, 0.543; P = .028) and family environment (ES, 0.663; P = .008), as well as moderate nonsignificant effect sizes for spiritual perspective (ES, 0.450; P = .071) and self-transcendence (ES, 0.424; P = .088). Conclusions: The TMV intervention improves positive health outcomes of courageous coping, social integration, and family environment during a high-risk cancer treatment. We recommend the TMV be examined in a broader population of AYAs with high-risk cancers."

This phenomenon has been described in subjects with stroke, suggesting that it could play a role in hand rehabilitation. The aim of this study is to analyse the effectiveness of playing a musical keyboard in improving hand function in subjects with multiple sclerosis. Methods: Nineteen hospitalized subjects were randomized in two groups: nine played a turned-on musical keyboard by sequences of fingers movements (audio feedback present) and 10 performed the same exercises on a turned-off musical keyboard (audio feedback absent). Training duration was half an hour per day for 15 days. Primary outcome was the perceived hand functional use measured by ABILHAND Questionnaire. Secondary outcomes were hand dexterity, measured by Nine-Hole Peg Test, and hand strength, measured by Jamar and Pinch dynamometers. Two-way analysis of variance was used for data analysis. Results: The interaction time × group was significant (p = 0.003) for ABILHAND Questionnaire in favour of experimental group (mean between-group difference 0.99 logit [IC95%: 0.44; 1.54]). The two groups showed a significant time effect for all outcomes except for Jamar measure. Discussion: Playing a musical keyboard seems a valid method to train the functional use of hands in subjects with multiple sclerosis."

Ten participants formed the therapy group, and 10 the control group. The groups were comparable on the standard neurological classification scheme Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). Exclusion criteria were pregnancy and mental disorders requiring medication. Measurements were taken before therapy began (T1), and subsequently every 3 months (T2-T4). This battery included indicators of clinical depression and anxiety (Beck Depression Inventory and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), a self-acceptance scale (SESA) and a life quality assessment (Hamburg Quality of Life Questionnaire in Multiple Sclerosis). In addition, data were collected on cognitive (MSFC) and functional (EDSS) parameters. Patients in the therapy group received 3 blocks of music therapy in single sessions over the course of the one year project (8 to 10 sessions respectively). The music therapy approach used for this study is based on the Nordoff Robbins approach (Nordoff & Robbins, 1977). There was no significant difference between the music therapy treatment group and the control group. However, the effect size statistics comparing both groups show a medium effect size on the scales measuring self esteem (d = 0.5423, r =.026), depression HAD-D (d = 0.63, r = 0.310) and anxiety HAD-A (d = 0.63, r = 0.310). Significant improvements were found for the therapy group over time (T1-T4) in the scale values of self esteem, depression, and anxiety. Given the stigmatizing effect of a chronic degenerative disease, the positive benefits of music therapy point to a realm of aesthetic considerations in assessing clinical improvement."

This study aimed at evaluating the feasibility and potential efficacy of a novel treatment involving music plus treadmill in patients with MS. Ten patients affected by secondary progressive MS were submitted to a specific training using the Gait Trainer (GT) 3, a platform that integrates gait training via a treadmill and rhythmic auditory stimulation. The 30 minutes training was performed three times per week for eight weeks (24 sessions in total). The enrolled patients were compared with a control group (CG) of 10 patients with MS matched for age, gender, disease duration, and EDSS stage. The CG received the same amount of treatment, but using conventional overground gait training. All patients completed the training without reporting any side effects. At the end of the training, CG improved in static and dynamic balance and in mood. Instead, in the EG a significant improvement in static and dynamic balance, walking speed, and mobility, as well as in mood, and perception of quality of life (QoL), both for physical and mental well-being, was found. This exploratory study suggests that GT3 might be a feasible and potentially useful approach for MS gait rehabilitation, thanks to patients' high motivation and good acceptance of the music assisted therapy."

The typical pattern of cognitive impairment includes reduced speed of information processing, decreased phonological and semantic speech fluency, deficits in verbal and visual episodic memory, as well as attention and executive dysfunctions. We aimed to investigate the influence of the neurologic music therapy (NMT) on mood, motivation, emotion status, and cognitive functions in patients with MS. Methods: Thirty patients with MS were randomly divided in 2 groups: the control group (CG) undergoing conventional cognitive rehabilitation (CCR), 6 times a week for 8 weeks, and the experimental group (EG) undergoing CCR 3 times a week for 8 weeks plus NMT techniques, performed 3 times a week for 8 weeks. All the participants were submitted to the same amount of treatment. Each patient was evaluated before (baseline: T0) and immediately after the end of each training (T1). Main outcomes measures: We used as main outcome measure: the brief repeatable battery of neuropsychological test to assess various cognitive abilities; and the multiple sclerosis quality of life-54 (MSQoL-54). Results: Both the groups benefit from 8 weeks of CR. In particular, the EG got better results in cognitive function, with regard to selective reminding test long term storage (P < .000), long term retrieval (P = .007), and delayed recall of the 10\/36 spatial recall test (P = .001), as compared with the CG. Moreover, the improvement in emotional status, motivation, mood and quality of life (with regard to the mental component; P < .000) was more evident in the EG. Conclusions: NMT could be considered a complementary approach to enhance CCR in patients affected by MS."

        "Abstract":"Background and aims: Dental anxiety has been found to be a significant problem faced by patients undergoing extractions. Anxious patients tend to avoid dental care ultimately leading to complications. Treatment of anxious patients can be very challenging to the dentists, prolonging the treatment duration. There has been various methods to reduce anxiety of which non pharmacological ways include music and aroma therapy. Music has been known to reduce fear, stress and is a form of meditation and relaxation. Hence effect of music on the reduction of anxiety levels for patients undergoing extractions were assessed. The aim of this study is to assess the effect of music therapy on dental anxiety levels of patients undergoing extractions. Methods: 50 patients visiting the outpatient department of Saveetha Dental College for dental extractions were randomly selected and allocated to Test group and Control group. The test group (N = 25) were subjected to music during extractions and Control (N = 25) were not exposed. Dental anxiety levels and hemodynamic changes namely systolic pressure, diastolic pressure and heart rate were assessed before and after extraction. The data was collected and analyzed using SPSS software with Paired t Test. Results: The study showed that the control population had elevated hemodynamic changes with regard to systolic, diastolic blood pressure and heart rate, of which the diastolic pressure rise was significant. In the test population, there was fall in the hemodynamic changes with respect to systolic diastolic blood pressure and heart rate, all of which were statistically significant. This was evident in the modified dental anxiety scale as well. Conclusion: Music seems to be a psychological and spiritual way to calm oneself down. Hence music therapy can be used as an anxiolytic agent for stressful dental procedures."

For each patient was measured for salivary cortisol, stimulate salivary flow, blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation and body temperature. Student t-test and Chi2 were applied to analyze significant differences between the studied variables before and after the unpleasant stimulation causes anxiety for dental treatment. Results: Initially, both groups registered the same level of anxiety. In the second measurement, significant differences were registered in the salivary cortisol concentration, systolic and diastolic pressure, heart rate, body temperature and stimulated salivary flow for treated group with music therapy. Conclusion: Music therapy has a positive effect in control of dental anxiety."

        "Abstract":"Objective To evaluate the effectiveness of music therapy for dental anxiety disorders. Methods In order to gather clinical randomized controlled trials comparing the effectiveness of music interventions to traditional oral manipulation in patients with dental anxiety disorders, computer searches of the electronic databases of Wanfang, CNKI, VIP, PubMed, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, Cochrane library, Scopus, and CINAHL were conducted. The search period covered from 23 December 2022, through to the development of the database. The Cochrane Handbook was used to assess the quality of the included literature, and two researchers independently conducted the literature screening and data extraction. Stata 17.0 and RevMan 5.3 were used to conduct the meta-analysis. Results The preoperative baseline levels of the music intervention group were similar to those of the control group (p > 0.05), according to the meta-analysis, and music intervention significantly decreased heart rate (I2 = 81.2%, WMD (95% CI): -7.33 (-10.07, -4.58), p < 0.0001), systolic blood pressure fluctuations (I2 = 85.6%, WMD (95% CI): -6.10(-9.25, 2.95), p < 0.0001), diastolic blood pressure (I2 = 79.7%, WMD (95% CI): -4.29(-6.57, -2.02), p < 0.0001) fluctuations, anxiety scores (I2 = 19.6%, WMD (95% CI): -9.04(-11.45, 6.63), p < 0.0001), and pain scores (I2 = 32.7%, WMD (95% CI): -7.64(-9.43, -5.85), p < 0.0001), as well as significantly lowered anxiety and pain levels and raised patients' cooperation rates (I2 = 0%, OR (95% CI): 3.03(1.24, 7.40), p = 0.02). Conclusions Music interventions are effective for dental anxiety disorders, but given the limitations of the study, more multicenter, large-sample, high-quality randomized controlled trials are needed to further validate the findings and obtain more objective and reliable clinical evidence."

        "Abstract":"Background: After receiving neurologic music therapy, functional improvements in children with severe bilateral cerebral palsy have not been found in the literature. Musical training with instruments allows interrelationships between movement, emotions and cognition for task-based learning, in order to improve motor control. Aim: To understand whether neurologic music therapy has an impact on the functionality of children with severe cerebral palsy. Design: A randomized controlled assessor-blind trial was carried out. Setting: Children were recruited and treated in their own community center. Population: Eighteen children with severe bilateral cerebral palsy between 4 and 16 years old were studied. Methods: The intervention group (N.=18) received music therapy for 16 weeks, in addition to its usual physiotherapy input. Two music therapists implemented a neurologic music therapy program of therapeutic instrumental music performance. The control group (N.=9) received its usual therapeutic input, similar to the intervention group, but not neurologic music therapy. Overall and specific \"Chailey levels of Ability\" were quantified, as well as the locomotor stages. Results: Significant improvements in the overall and specific \"arm and hand position\" as well as \"activities\" from the Chailey Levels of Ability and the locomotor stages were observed (P<0.05) in the group which received the music therapy. All these improvements persisted after 4 months. The control group showed no improvements after a four-month follow-up. Conclusions: Optimized intervention of neurologic music therapy can improve the functionality of children with severe bilateral cerebral palsy. Clinical rehabilitation impact: Music therapy is a useful tool in rehabilitation and its positive effects remain four months after completing the treatment."

        "Abstract":"Background: Cerebral palsy (CP) is one of the most common causes of disability in children. It is characterized by impairment in motor function and coordination and difficulties in performing daily life activities. Previous research supports that neurologic music therapy (NMT) was effective in improving motor function, cognition, and emotional wellbeing in patients with various neurologic disorders. However, the benefit of NMT in patients with CP have not yet been thoroughly investigated. The aim of this review was to investigate the potential effect of NMT motor rehabilitation techniques for patients. Materials and methods: We searched articles published up to May 24, 2022 in PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Cochrane library, Web of science, and Ovid MEDLINEdatabases. We included studies that investigated the effect of NMT in patients with CP. Results: After search, 4,117 articles were identified using the search terms. After reading the titles and abstracts, 4,089 articles that did not meet our inclusion criteria were excluded. The remaining 28 articles which were assessed for eligibility. Finally, 15 studies were included in this systematic review. Among 15 studies that investigated the effect of NMT on patients with CP, 7 studies were on rhythmic auditory stimulation (RAS), 6 studies were on therapeutic instrumental music performance (TIMP), and 2 studies were on patterned sensory enhancement (PSE). Conclusions: Various techniques of NMT brings beneficial effects for gross and fine motor improvements in patients with CP. NMT techniques, such as RAS, TIMP, and PSE, may be a potential alternative rehabilitation strategy to enhance gross and fine motor skills for patients with CP."

Nine adolescent cerebral palsy patients admitted to the Pediatric Disability Clinic between 2018 and 2020 and 9 healthy adolescent volunteers as control group were included. Therapeutic Instrumental Music Performance method was applied 2 days a week, 3 months in 40-min sessions. Before\/after intervention, MACS, Box Block Test, Nine-Hole Peg Test, Jamar hand dynamometer and key pressing force of fingers were evaluated with Cubase MIDI program. Five of our patients included in the study were spastic hemiplegic and 4 were spastic diplegic cerebral palsy. All measurements made after intervention were found to be statistically significant compared to the measurements made before piano training (p < 0.05). The fingers that improved the most in the key pressing force of the fingers were found as the right hand 4th, left hand the 4th and 5th fingers (p < 0.01). A significant strong negative relationship was detected between the Box Block Test and the Nine-Hole Peg Test (p < 0.001). With therapeutic instrumental music performance method, functional gains can be achieved in the grip strength, strengths of the fingers, gross and fine motor skills of adolescent cerebral palsy patients. Further studies are needed to establish a piano training protocol in neurological music therapy."

Methods: Sixty children with cerebral palsy were randomly divided into an acupuncture group (Group Acup.) and an acupuncture plus music group (Group Acup.+ M). Simple acupuncture was applied in Group Acup., and acupuncture at 5 groups of points plus music were applied in Group Acup. +M. The treatment was given once every two days with 3 treatments weekly, and 36 treatments constituted a therapeutic course. Therapeutic effects including movement improvement were observed for comparison after 3 courses of treatments. Results: The comprehensive functions were elevated in both groups, and the total effective rate in Group Acup. + M was obviously better than that in Group Acup (P < 0.05). Movement functions were also improved in both groups, but the differences in improvement of creeping and kneeling, standing, and walking were significant between the two groups (P < 0.01), showing the effect in Group Acup. + M was better than that in Group Acup.. Conclusion: The therapy of acupuncture plus music gained better therapeutic effect on cerebral palsy than simple acupuncture, which provided new thoughts for treating the disease by comprehensive therapies."

Method: Forty-five older adult participants with MCI (74.62 ± 5.05 years) participated in this randomized, controlled, single-blind intervention trial. 35 were assigned to the MMT group and 10 to the control STT group. Before and after the 12-week exercise program, we administered six physical function tests, the Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB), and measured relative oxyhemoglobin concentrations using 45-multichannel functional near-infrared spectroscopy as a reflection of hemodynamic responses in the PFC. Results: We observed significant improvements in FAB scores only in the MMT group. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the PFC during the exercise was significantly increased in the MMT group compared with the STT group. The CBF increase was significantly correlated among various channels in the MMT group. Conclusions: The MMT program appeared to stimulate the PFC and improve cognitive performance in our older adult participants with MCI, suggesting that the repetitive, rhythmic movements of MMT can activate the prefrontal area in older adults.

        "Abstract":"Twelve older adults with cognitive impairments who were participants in weekly community-based group music therapy sessions, 6 older adults in an Alzheimer's caregivers' group, and 6 college student volunteers listened to a 3.5 minute prepared audiotape of instrumental excerpts of patriotic selections. The tape consisted of 7 excerpts ranging from 18 s to 34 s in duration. Each music excerpt was followed by a 7-9 s period of silence, a \"wait\" excerpt. Listeners were instructed to move a Continuous Response Digital Interface (CRDI) to the name of the music excerpt depicted on the CRDI overlay when they heard a music excerpt. Likewise, they were instructed to move the dial to the word \"WAIT\" when there was no music. They were also instructed to maintain the dial position for the duration of each music or silence excerpt. Statistical analysis indicated no significant differences between the caregivers' and the college students' group means for total dial changes, correct and incorrect recognitions, correct and incorrect responses to silence excerpts, and reaction times. The mean scores of these 2 groups were combined and compared with the mean scores of the group of elderly adults with cognitive impairments. The mean total dial changes were significantly lower for the listeners with cognitive impairments, resulting in significant differences in all of the other response categories except incorrect recognitions. In addition, their mean absence of response to silence excerpts was significantly higher than their mean absence of responding to music excerpts. Their mean reaction time was significantly slower than the comparison group's reaction time. To evaluate training effects, 10 of the original 12 music therapy participants repeated the listening task with assistance from the therapist (treatment) immediately following the first listening (baseline). A week later the order was reversed for the 2 listening trials. Statistical and graphic analysis of responses between first and second baseline responses indicate significant improvement in responses to silence and music excerpts over the 2 sessions. Applications of the findings to music listening interventions for maintaining attention, eliciting social interaction between clients or caregivers and their patients, and evaluating this population's affective responses to music are discussed."

        "Abstract":"The effect of music therapy on cognitive function has been widely reported; however, its clinical implications remain controversial. Performing therapeutic musical activities in groups using individualized instruments can help overcome the issues of engagement and compliance. We aimed to evaluate the effect of a cognitive intervention with musical stimuli using digital devices on mild cognitive impairment (MCI). In this prospective study, 24 patients with MCI (intervention group, 12; and control group, 12) were enrolled. We developed an electronic device with musical instruments and the Song-based Cognitive Stimulation Therapy protocol (SongCST). Patients in the intervention group underwent a 10-week cognitive intervention involving musical stimuli generated by our device. Effect of the intervention on cognitive function was evaluated by the Mini-Mental State Examination-Dementia Screening (MMSE-DS), Montreal Cognitive Assessment-Korean (MOCA-K), and Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes (CDR-SOB). In the intervention group, MMSE-DS and MOCA-K scores improved significantly after the 10-week intervention. The changes in MOCA-K and CDR-SB scores were significantly different between the intervention and control groups. Our study showed that music therapy with digital devices has a positive effect on the executive function and overall disease severity in patients with MCI. Our study can facilitate individualization of music therapy using digital devices in groups."

        "Abstract":"Background: Quantitative evidence for the effects of music on patients with disorders of consciousness (DOCs) was presented. This study was based on available studies to summarize the effect estimates of music for DOC patients. Methods: Three electronic databases were searched for studies that investigated the effects of music for DOC patients from start to July 2018. The summary results included functional scale, general physical indexes, electroencephalogram indexes, and favorable outcomes. The weighted mean difference and odds ratio with a corresponding 95% confidence interval were used to calculate continuous and frequency data using a random-effects model. This report adheres to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Results: Randomized controlled trials (3) and cohort studies (8) involving 201 DOC patients were included. Patients with DOCs receiving music interventions were associated with high levels of California Verbal Learning Test (P = .038) and persistent vegetative state (P < .001), whereas no significant differences were detected for agitated behavior scale (P = .982), Glasgow Coma Scale (P = .216), Mini-Mental State Examination (P = .215), music therapy in a vegetative or minimally conscious state (P = .590), and Stroop (P = 1.000). Furthermore, DOC patients receiving music intervention showed a significantly increased facial expression (P = .003) and reduced systolic blood pressure (P = .036), whereas no significant effects were observed on diastolic blood pressure (P = .777), heart rate (P = .666), oxygen saturation (P = .911), pulse (P = .899), respiratory frequency (P = .427), and temperature (P = .864). Moreover, music did not contribute significantly to electroencephalogram indexes including alpha (α), beta (β), delta (δ), and theta (θ) in the left and right hemispheres (P > .050). Finally, DOC patients receiving music intervention showed an increased incidence of favorable outcomes (P = .015). Conclusion: This quantitative meta-analysis indicated that music might play a critical role on the functional scale, general physical indexes, and favorable outcomes for DOC patients. Music therapy can easily be provided at the bedside by nurses working with DOC patients."

Materials and methods: Ninety patients with definite diagnosis of disorders of consciousness (DOC) were selected. These patients were randomly divided into control group, experiment 1 group and experiment 2 group, with 30 patients in each group. The control group was treated with routine clinical treatment and rehabilitation. In experiment 1 group, music therapy was added to the control group. In experimental group 2, music therapy combined with binaural α frequency difference therapy was added to the control group. All patients were assessed before and after 30 treatments. The assessment items included Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), Coma Recovery Scale revised (CRS-R), electroencephalogram (EEG), upper somatosensory evoked potential (USEP), and brainstem auditory evoked potential (BAEP). Results: Before treatment, there were no significant differences in GCS score, CRS-R score, USEP, BAEP, and EEG scores among the three groups (P > 0.05). After 30 times of treatment, GCS score, CRS-R score, USEP, BAEP, and EEG scores in 3 groups were significantly higher than those before treatment (P < 0.05), and experimental group 2 >experimental group 1 >control group (P < 0.05). And the consciousness rate of experimental group 2 was better than experimental group 1, experimental group 1 was better than the control group and the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Music therapy combined with binaural α frequency difference therapy is more effective in stimulating DOC patients."

        "Abstract":"Purpose Music therapy is an effective non-pharmacologic intervention that is cost-effective, easy to implement, and customize. It has been shown to significantly alleviate anxiety and improve patient satisfaction. In this study, we aimed to compare music therapy to a control (no music) group with respect to sedation requirements, anxiety levels, and patient satisfaction for patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty under spinal anesthesia. Methods In this randomized controlled study, we compared the effect of music therapy in patients ≥ 18 years old. Patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty were screened for the study to rule out any contraindications for spinal anesthesia. Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio for either the \"music\" or \"control\" group. Both groups were compared for sedation requirements, preoperative and postoperative anxiety levels, and patient satisfaction. Results Subjects in the music group had a statistically significant lower than average State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI)-State baseline score as compared to the control group (music group 31.00 (standard deviation (SD) 1.44), control group 38.04 (SD 2.35); p = 0.01). Postoperative STAI-State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI)-State scores for the music group were lower for the music group than the control group (music group 28.34 (SD 1.64), control group 32.21 (SD 1.56), p= 0.09). STAI-Trait scores were similar pre-operatively, but significantly less post-operatively in the music group (28.14 SD 1.0) as compared to the control group (34.71 SD 2.31); p = 0.01. Propofol dose per kilogram per surgical minute was similar between the two groups (music group 0.05, control group 0.06; p= 0.264). Patient satisfaction scores with their perioperative experience were higher in the music group (p= 0.009). Conclusions Music therapy may be offered as an alternative to traditional anxiolytics intra-operatively. However further studies are warranted to evaluate whether or not music therapy can decrease sedation and anxiolytic medications during surgery. The type and mode of delivery of music also need to be studied to better understand the impact of music therapy. Clinical trial registry: Clinicaltrials.gov # NCT03569397."

        "Abstract":"Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is a common orthopedic surgery known to be very painful. Emphasis has been placed on TKA pain management for postoperative care and during rehabilitation. Music therapy is used as a nonpharmacologic intervention for pain management and to promote rehabilitation exercise adherence. The objective of this study was to explore the effects of music therapy\/physical therapy co-treatment using live music-supported exercise on pain and exercise adherence during a lower extremity pedaling exercise to facilitate range of motion (ROM). The researcher randomized 32 TKA inpatient rehabilitation participants to an intervention or control group. Following baseline measures, two study intervals occurred with the intervention group receiving live music for the first interval followed by no music during the second interval; the control group received no music during both intervals. Self-reported pain measures, observed pain measures, and observed measures of pedaling adherence were collected for each participant. A mixed analysis of variance (ANOVA) with repeated measures showed no significant effects for self-reported pain perception. For observed pain, ANOVA results did show a significant interaction (p < .05) between group and study interval. There were no statistically significant effects for pedaling adherence. Conclusions show an important role for live music therapy intervention on observed pain while engaged in co-treatment during this lower extremity ROM exercise. Additional implications and limitations are discussed."

        "Abstract":"Joint lavage for knee osteoarthritis is an invasive procedure that can be stressful and painful. We aimed to assess the impact of music therapy on perioperative anxiety, pain and tolerability of the procedure in patients undergoing joint lavage performed with two needles. We randomized all patients diagnosed with knee osteoarthritis and undergoing joint lavage in our department from November 2009 to October 2010 to an experimental group listening to recorded music or a control group receiving no music intervention. Perioperative anxiety and pain related to the procedure were self-reported on a visual analogic scale (0-100 mm visual analog scale [VAS]), and heart rate and blood pressure were measured during the procedure. Tolerability was assessed on a four-grade scale directly after the procedure. We included 62 patients (31 in each group). Mean age was 68.8 ± 12.6 years (72% females). As compared with the control group, the music group had lower levels of perioperative anxiety (40.3 ± 31.1 vs. 58.2 ± 26.3 mm; p = 0.046) and pain related to the procedure (26.6 ± 16.2 vs. 51.2 ± 23.7 mm; p = 0.0005). Moreover, heart rate was lower in the music group (69.5 ± 11.4 vs. 77.2 ± 13.2; p = 0.043) but not diastolic or systolic blood pressure. Tolerability was higher in the music group (p = 0.002). Music is a simple and effective tool to alleviate pain and anxiety in patients undergoing joint lavage for knee osteoarthritis."

        "Abstract":"Background: A growing number of patients continue to receive total knee replacement (TKR) surgery. Nevertheless, such surgeries result in moderate to severe postoperative pain and difficulty in managing it. Musical interventions are regarded as a type of multimodal analgesia, achieving beneficial results in other clinical treatments. This study aims to evaluate the effect of musical interventions in improving short-term pain outcomes following TKR in order to determine a more reasonable and standard way of delivering musical intervention. Methods: A systematic search was conducted to identify available and relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) regarding musical interventions compared against non-musical interventions in patients treated with TKR in Embase, MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, CNKI, and Wanfang Med Online up to 8 January 2020. The authors independently assessed study eligibility and risk of bias and collected the outcomes of interest to analyze. The statistical analysis was conducted using the Review Manager (RevMan) version 5.30 software. Results: Eight RCTs comprised of 555 patients satisfied the inclusion criteria and were enrolled in the present study. The results showed no significant difference between the music and control groups in pain of the visual analog scale (VAS), during postoperative recovery room, back to the ward after surgery; anxiety degree of VAS; heart rate; respiratory rate; oxygen saturation; blood pressure, systolic blood pressure, and diastolic blood pressure. Nevertheless, significant differences were observed between the two groups in average increase in continuous passive motion (CPM) angles and LF\/HF ratio (one kind index of heart rate variability). Conclusions: Musical interventions fail to demonstrate an obvious effect in improving short-term pain outcomes following TKR. A reasonable standardization of musical interventions, including musical type, outcome measures used, outcomes measured, duration, timing and headphones or players, may improve pain outcomes with certain advantages and should be further explored after TKR."

        "Abstract":"Background: Music has emerged as a well-received medical intervention. Patients may be uncomfortable during total joint replacement, which can result in high sedation requirements. These requirements place elderly patients at risk for delirium. This study compares the effect of noise-cancellation versus music medicine on sedation requirements, pain, and opioid consumption during elective total knee replacement. Methods: This prospective, double-blinded, randomized clinical trial was conducted at Virginia Commonwealth University Medical Center between July 2018 and July 2019. All participants underwent primary total knee arthroplasty with a combined spinal-epidural as their primary anesthetic and received noise-cancelling, wireless headphones. Patients in the control group received the noise-cancellation feature only, while patients in the experimental group were permitted to listen to music of their choice. Patients signaled a request for sedation by squeezing a noise-making rubber hippopotamus toy. The primary outcomes included whether sedation was requested by the participant, the number of sedation demand doses requested, and the amount of propofol sedation administered during the procedure. Secondary outcomes included postoperative pain scores, total opioid consumption, and time to first opioid request. Results: Seventy-one percent (n = 36) of patients agreed to participate in the study. Forty-four percent of participants in the noise-cancellation group and 19% of participants in the music group requested sedation (P = .25). The median propofol consumption was not different between groups (0 [0-6.7] µg\/kg\/min vs 0 [0-0] µg\/kg\/min, P = .101 for noise cancellation vs music, respectively). Pain scores and opioid consumption were not different between groups. Discussion: To date, this is the first study to use Bluetooth communication, noise-cancellation, and an Internet-based music streaming service to determine whether this technology has an impact on outcomes during major orthopedic surgery. Conclusion: As an isolated intervention, the benefits of music in a complex operating room environment may be overstated. However, music integration with noise-reduction technology and patient-controlled sedation may lead to a safer and more satisfying anesthetic. More research is needed to determine the nonpharmacologic interventions that will produce positive outcomes for the geriatric population."

        "Abstract":"Background: Non-pharmacological interventions such as music are being increasingly used in clinical settings. Objective: To assess the effects of music on patients undergoing total knee replacement (TKR) surgery under subarachnoid anesthesia. Methods: This randomized controlled trial examined participants (45\/group) in a music and non-music group. Anxiety was measured in both the groups using (1) the adapted hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS), (2) Spielberger state trait anxiety inventory (STAI-S), (3) visual analog scale (VAS), (4) cortisol levels, and (5) blood pressure. Music was delivered using an MP3 player and headphones. Hemodynamic data was collected before, during, and after music therapy. Cortisol and stress levels were measured postoperatively. VAS was assessed 30 min before surgery, 30 min after the administration of anesthesia, and 30 min after the surgery ended in the recovery room to obtain comparative data on pain levels at 3 different phases using a numeric rating scale. Results: Changes in the mean VAS scores from the pre-to postoperative phase were significantly different between the music and non-music groups (p = .001). The mean (±standard deviation [SD]) HADS and STAI-S scores of the non-music group were higher than those in the music group (HADS:15.58 ± 2.231 vs 11.91 ± 3.218; STAI-S: 54.04 ± 2.899 vs 48.87 ± 4.595). There were significant differences in the mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure and mean heart rate between the groups based on time (both, p < .001). Correlation regression analysis for the cortisol level revealed a certain relationship between age and cortisol level (p < .05). Conclusions: These results suggest that music can reduce patients' anxiety level in the operating room. Studies on music therapy for patients undergoing lower limb orthopedic surgery, especially under subarachnoid anesthesia, are extremely limited. Therefore, this study can serve as a reference regarding the application of music therapy in the medical field."

        "Abstract":"Background: Music therapy (MT) research has demonstrated positive effects on fatigue, depressed mood, anxiety, and pain in perioperative care areas. However, there has been limited research on the effects of MT for surgical patients on orthopaedic units. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to understand the impact of MT sessions on post-elective orthopaedic surgery patients' pain, mood, nausea, anxiety, use of narcotics and antiemetics, and length of stay. Methods: This was a randomized controlled study with an experimental arm (MT sessions) and a control arm (standard medical care). Patients received MT within 24 hours of admission to the unit, as well as every day of their stay. Same-day pre- and postdata were collected 30 minutes apart for both arms, including patient self-reported mood, pain, anxiety, and nausea. Use of medications and length of stay were gleaned from the electronic medical record. Results: Data were obtained for 163 patients, age 60.5 ± 11.1 years, 56% of whom were male. Joints targeted by surgeries were hips (54%), knees (42%), and shoulders (4%). There were significantly greater changes favoring the MT group on Day 1 (pain, anxiety, and mood), Day 2 (pain, anxiety, mood, and nausea), and Day 3 (pain, anxiety, and mood). Among participants with a pre-pain score of 2 or more on Day 1, a decrease of at least 2 points was noted in 36% of the MT group and 10% of the control group (P < .001). Overall, 73% of MT patients versus 41% of control patients reported improved pain (P < .001). No significant between-group differences in medications or length of stay were noted. Conclusions: We observed greater same-day improvements of pain, emotional status, and nausea with MT sessions, compared to usual care, in patients hospitalized after elective orthopaedic surgeries. Effects on narcotic and antiemetic usage, as well as length of stay, were not observed. More research needs to be conducted to better understand the benefits of MT pre- and post-elective orthopaedic surgery."

        "Abstract":"Introduction: Patients undergoing surgery are anxious owing to the surgery, anesthesia, and unfamiliar environment of the operation theater. This anxiety can hamper the health and recovery of the patients. Among various nonpharmacologic modalities available, music can be used as a coping strategy to change uncomfortable conditions to the pleasant ones. Aims: To evaluate the role of music on perioperative anxiety, hemodynamic parameters, and patient satisfaction in patients undergoing orthopedic surgeries under spinal anesthesia. Settings and design: Tertiary care hospital, randomized control trial. Materials and methods: : The study was conducted after approval by Hospital Ethical Committee on 70 adult patients of either gender scheduled to undergo lower limb surgeries under spinal anesthesia. In group M (n = 35), patients listened to standard relaxation music, and in group C (n = 35), patients listened to standard operation theater noise tape through noise canceling headphones. The intraoperative hemodynamic parameters were recorded. Perioperative anxiety was assessed using visual analog scale for anxiety. Sedation score was observed using observer's assessment of alertness\/sedation scale. Patient's satisfaction was also assessed in both the groups. Statistical analysis: Student t test, Chi-squared test, and paired sample t test. Results: : In group M, heart rate was lower when compared with group C. The difference was statistically significant at 10 minutes of assessment (P = 0.003) and statistically highly significant (P < 0.001) for rest of the time period. Statistically significant lower respiratory rate was there in group M when compared with group C (P = 0.05). Patients were more satisfied in the music group when compared with control group. Conclusion: The potential of music therapy can be used to allay patient anxiety, stabilize hemodynamics, and improve patient satisfaction."

Background: Surgery-related anxiety and pain are the greatest concern of surgical patients, especially for those undergoing major procedures. Design: A quasi-experimental study design was conducted in a medical centre in Taiwan from April-July 2006. Methods: Sixty patients were recruited. The study group listened to selected music from the evening before surgery to the second day after surgery. The control group did not listen to music. Patients' levels of anxiety and pain were measured with visual analogue scales (VAS). Physiological measures, including heart rate, blood pressure and 24-hour urinalysis, were performed. Results: The average age of the 60 patients was 62·18 (SD 18·76) years. The mean VAS score for degree of anxiety in the study group was 0·8-2·0, compared with 2·1-5·1 in the control group. The mean VAS score for degree of pain in the study group was 1·7-3·0, compared with 4·4-6·0 in the control group. The differences between the two groups in VAS scores for both anxiety (p = 0·018-0·001) and pain (p = 0·001) were statistically significant. One hour after surgery, the mean blood pressure was significantly lower in the study group than in the control group (p = 0·014), but no significant differences were found between the two groups in urine cortisol (p = 0·145-0·495), norepinephrine (p = 0·228-0·626) or epinephrine values (p = 0·074-0·619). Conclusions: Music therapy has some positive effects on levels of anxiety and pain in patients undergoing spinal surgery. Relevance to clinical practice: Complementary music therapy can alleviate pain and anxiety in patients before and after spinal surgery."

This study employed a pre- and posttest experimental design with nonrandom assignment. Ninety-seven women undergoing gynecologic surgery were included in the study, where 49 were allocated to the control group (nonmusic group) and 48 were assigned to the experimental group (music group). Preoperative anxiety was measured using the State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) while noninvasive instruments were used in measuring the patients' physiologic parameters (blood pressure [BP], pulse [P], and respiration [R]) at two time periods. Women allocated in the experimental group had lower STAI scores (t = 17.41, p < .05), systolic (t = 6.45, p < .05) and diastolic (t = 2.80, p < .006) BP, and P rate (PR; t = 7.32, p < .05) than in the control group. This study provides empirical evidence to support the use of music during the preoperative period in reducing anxiety and unpleasant symptoms in women undergoing gynecologic surgery."

        "Abstract":"Introduction Nasal septal surgery is one of the most common surgeries performed by otolaryngology surgeons; however, anxiety before surgery and postoperative pain remain a significant cause of morbidity. The search for a complimentary modality to reduce the symptoms and side effects has gained momentum in recent years. Objective Music therapy is an exciting and inexpensive modality in this regard, but scientific evidence in terms of randomized clinical trials is still lacking for common otolaryngology surgeries. Hence, we performed the present study. Method The sample of our study was composed of 59 patients, 30 of which were submitted to conventional medicine, while the remaining 29 were submitted to both conventional medicine and music therapy with music of their own choice, with 2 sessions per day, each lasting 30 minutes. This was performed using the generalized anxiety disorder-7 scale and the pain visual analogue scale until postoperative day 2, when the patients were discharged from the hospital. Result On comparing the anxiety and pain scores between the two groups, the group who underwent music therapy showed a statistically significant reduction in anxiety both preoperatively ( p < 0.0001) and postoperatively ( p < 0.0001), as well as reduced postoperative pain starting from day 0 ( p < 0.001), which continued until postoperative day 2 ( p < 0.001). Conclusion Music therapy is an effective adjunct in the control of anxiety and postoperative pain following nasal septal surgery."

        "Abstract":"Background: Pain is a common phenomenon after surgery. Cardiac surgeries are no exception and patients generally experience acute pain after these surgeries. Inadequate pain management after cardiac surgery predisposes patients to many complications. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the effects of listening to preferred music on pain intensity after open heart surgery. Materials and methods: This study was a randomized clinical trial (RCT) conducted in open heart intensive care unit (ICU) of a university hospital in Sari, Iran. A total of 60 patients who were scheduled to undergo open heart surgery were randomly allocated in two groups. Patients in the intervention group (n = 30) listened to their preferred music by headphones for 30 minutes, whereas those in the control group (n = 30) did not listen to music. Using a Numerical Rating Scale (NRS), pain intensity was measured among the patients before the intervention, and immediately, 30 minutes and one hour after the intervention. Data was analyzed by Chi-square test, student's t-test and repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). Findings: Mean pain intensity in the intervention group before, immediately after, 30 minutes and one hour after the intervention were 5.8, 3.1, 2.5 and 2.4, respectively. Corresponding numbers in the control group were 4.7, 4.7, 4.8 and 4.9, respectively. Repeated measures ANOVA showed music to significantly reduce pain intensity (p = 0.0001). Conclusions: Music can be effective as a non-pharmacological, inexpensive, non-invasive and side effect free method for pain management after open heart surgery."

        "Abstract":"Background: Both end-stage renal disease and being wait-listed for a kidney transplant are anxiety-causing situations. Wait-listed patients usually require arteriovenous fistula surgery for dialysis access. This procedure is performed under local anesthesia. We investigated the effects of music on the anxiety, perceived pain and satisfaction levels of patients who underwent fistula surgery. Aim: To investigate the effect of music therapy on anxiety levels and perceived pain of patients undergoing fistula surgery. Methods: Patients who were on a waiting list for kidney transplants and scheduled for fistula surgery were randomized to control and music groups. The music group patients listened to music throughout the fistula surgery. The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory was performed to assess anxiety, additionally visual analog scale was used to evaluate perceived pain, willingness to repeat the procedure and patient satisfaction. Demographic features, comorbidities, surgical history, basic surgical data (location of fistula creation, duration of surgery, incision length) and intra-operative hemodynamic parameters were recorded by an investigator blinded to the study group. An additional trait anxiety assessment was performed following the surgery. Results: There was a total of 55 patients included in the study. However, 14 patients did not fulfill the criteria due to requirement of sedation during surgery or uncompleted questionnaires. The remaining 41 patients were included in the analysis. There were 26 males and 15 females. The control and music groups consisted of 20 and 21 patients, respectively. With regard to basic surgical and demographic data, there was no difference between the groups. Overall patient satisfaction was significantly higher and intra-operative heart rate and blood pressure were significantly lower in the music group (P < 0.05). Postoperative state anxiety levels were significantly lower in the music group. Conclusion: Music therapy can be a complimentary treatment for patients undergoing fistula surgery. It can reduce anxiety and perceived pain, improve intraoperative hemodynamic parameters and enhance treatment satisfaction, thus may contribute to better compliance of the patients."

This study was conducted alongside a prospective single-masked randomized controlled trial (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02892825). Patients undergoing first eye cataract surgery were included and randomly assigned to either the intervention or control group. Patients in the intervention group had a 20-min music session through earphones before surgery, while patients in the control group wore earphones without music. Anxiety level evaluated using the visual analog scale and heart rate were collected before and after music intervention. Pain level was assessed using the Numerical Pain Rating Scale, during the surgical procedure, prior to discharge and 7 days postoperatively. A total of 243 patients were included: 119 in the intervention group and 124 in the control group. No significant differences in baseline characteristics, including age, sex and rate of treated hypertension were found between the 2 groups (all p-values > 0.05). In addition, no significantly differences were found in heart rate and anxiety level before music intervention between the 2 groups (all p-values > 0.05). Conversely, anxiety level was significantly lower in the music group after the intervention (respectively, 1.3 ± 1.1 vs 3.2 ± 2.2; p < 0.05). Patients in the music group reported a lower mean pain level during surgical procedure and before discharge compared with control group (respectively, 1.2 ± 0.5 vs 2.1 ± 1.1, p = 0.03 and 0.23 ± 0.4 vs 0.81 ± 0.7, p = 0.04). No difference was found in pain level 7 days postoperatively (0.1 ± 0.3 vs 0.2 ± 0.4, p = 0.1). A significant correlation was found between anxiety level and intraoperative pain level (R = 0.64, p = 0.02). In conclusion, music intervention was effective in reducing anxiety level and self-reported pain both during surgery and in the early postoperative period.

Methods: Sixty patients undergoing day surgery were randomized to one of three groups, each containing 20 patients. Before and during surgery, patients in group 1 listened to new age music and those in group 2 listened to a choice of music from one of four styles. Patients in group 3 (control group) heard the normal sounds of the operating theatre. Plasma levels of cortisol and subpopulations of lymphocytes were evaluated before, during and after operation. Results: Plasma cortisol levels decreased during operation in both groups of patients who listened to music, but increased in the control group. Postoperative cortisol levels were significantly higher in group 1 than in group 2 (mean(s.d.) 14.21(6.96) versus 8.63(2.72) ng\/dl respectively; P < 0.050). Levels of natural killer lymphocytes decreased during surgery in groups 1 and 2, but increased in controls. Intraoperative levels of natural killer cells were significantly lower in group 1 than in group 3 (mean(s.d.) 212.2(89.3) versus 329.1(167.8) cells\/microl; P < 0.050). Conclusion: Perioperative music therapy changed the neurohormonal and immune stress response to day surgery, especially when the type of music was selected by the patient."

It is essential to find strategies to manage pre-surgery anxiety and prevent unwanted consequences in patients. Aromatherapy and music therapy can be used to help patients managing their pre-surgery anxiety. Objective: To compare the effects of Geranium aromatherapy and music therapy on the anxiety level of patients undergoing inguinal hernia surgery. Methods: This randomized clinical trial was conducted in Imam Educational Hospital in Mahabad, Iran. One hundred and fifty patients were recruited and randomly allocated to aromatherapy, music therapy, and control groups. The Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory was used to measure the patients' pre-surgery anxiety (primary outcome) before and after the intervention. Geranium essential oil and instrumental music were used in aromatherapy and music therapy groups respectively. The patients in the control group received no intervention. The data were analyzed with SPSS version 25.0. Results: The results showed significant differences in the mean anxiety score of aromatherapy, music therapy, and control groups (P=0.011). Inhalation Geranium aromatherapy and music therapy groups had significantly lower mean anxiety scores compared with the control group after the intervention (P<0.001). Moreover, the value of decrease in the mean anxiety score was greater in the aromatherapy group compared to the music therapy group. Conclusions: Music therapy and aromatherapy are recommended as inexpensive and safe complementary medicine. These methods are effective strategies to assist patients with managing their pre-surgery anxiety, which results in reduced patient post-surgery complications and shorter surgery recovery time."

        "Abstract":"Introduction: Music has been used for several years as a relaxation method to reduce stress and anxiety. It is a painless, safe, inexpensive and practical nonpharmacologic therapeutic modality, widely used all over the world. Objectives: We aimed to evaluate the effect of music therapy on intraoperative awareness, patient satisfaction, awakening pain and waking quality in patients undergoing elective septorhinoplasty under general anesthesia. Methods: This randomized, controlled, prospective study was conducted with 120 patients undergoing septorhinoplasty within a 2 months period. The patients were randomly selected and divided into two groups: group music (music during surgery) and control group (without music during surgery). All patients underwent standard general anesthesia. Patients aged 18-70 years who would undergo a planned surgery under general anesthesia were included. Patients who had emergency surgery, hearing or cognitive impairment, were excluded from the study. Results: A total of 120 patients were enrolled, and separated into two groups. There were no statistically significant differences between the groups in terms of demographic characteristics, anesthesia and surgery durations (p>0.05). In the music group, sedation agitation scores were lower than those in the control group at the postoperative period (3.76±1.64 vs. 5.11±2.13; p<0.001). In addition; in patients of the music group, the pain level (2.73±1.28 vs. 3.61±1.40) was lower (p<0.001), requiring less analgesic drugs intake. Conclusion: Music therapy, which is a nonpharmacologic intervention, is an effective method, without side effects, leading to positive effects in the awakening, hemodynamic parameters and analgesic requirements in the postoperative period. It is also effective in reducing the anxiety and intraoperative awareness episodes of surgical patients."

Results indicate a positive correlation between children's and parental assessments in children older than 3 years (P < .001). Conclusions: Nonpharmacologic distraction is recommended as a supplement to conventional postoperative pain management. Parental assessment is a reliable proxy in assessing postoperative pain in children younger than 5 years."

        "Abstract":"Aims and objectives: The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of music therapy on stress, anxiety and depression in Taiwanese pregnant women. Background: The value of music therapy is slowly being realized by nurses in various clinical areas, including obstetrics. Previous studies have demonstrated a high prevalence of psychological stress during pregnancy. Few studies have examined the effects of music therapy on reducing psychological stress during pregnancy. Design: A randomized experimental study design was developed and implemented. Methods: Two hundred and thirty-six pregnant women were randomly assigned to music therapy (n = 116) and control (n = 120) groups. The music therapy group received two weeks of music intervention. The control group received only general prenatal care. Psychological health was assessed using three self-report measures: Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), State Scale of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (S-STAI) and Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). Results: In a paired t-test, the music therapy group showed significant decrease in PSS, S-STAI and EPDS after two weeks. The control group only showed a significant decrease in PSS after two weeks. This decrease was not as substantial as in the experimental group. An ancova test with the pretest scores as the control revealed that the changes in PSS, S-STAI and EPDS after two weeks were significantly decreased in the experimental group compared with the control group. Conclusions: This controlled trial provides preliminary evidence that two-week music therapy during pregnancy provides quantifiable psychological benefits. Relevance to clinical practice: The findings can be used to encourage pregnant women to use this cost-effective method of music in their daily life to reduce their stress, anxiety and depression. Further research is needed to test the long-term benefits."

Objective: to investigate the effect of music therapy on maternal anxiety, before and after a non-stress test (NST), and the effect of maternal anxiety on the birthing process and birth size. Methods: 409 nulliparous women coming for routine prenatal care were randomized in the third trimester to receive either music therapy (n = 204) or no music therapy (n = 205) during an NST. Maternal anxiety was assessed using the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory before and after the NST. Results: After the NST, the women from the music group showed significantly lower scores in state anxiety (OR = 0.87; p < 0.001) as well as trait anxiety (p < 0.001) than the control group. Furthermore, the pregnant women from the music group presented lower levels of state-trait anxiety than the control group in relation to the variables of birth process, and higher birth weight and chest circumference in the newborn (OR = 3.5 and OR = 0.81, respectively; p < 0.05). Limitations: This study was limited by the fact that it was a single-centre study; the observers conducting the NST were not blinded to the allocation, although neither midwife had any knowledge of the maternal anxiety scores, and we could not apply the double-blind method due to the nature of the observation. Conclusions: Our findings confirm that music therapy intervention during pregnancy could reduce elevated state-trait anxiety levels during the third trimester.

Aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of music therapy on postpartum pain, anxiety level, satisfaction and early pospartum depression rate. Methods: Totally 161 primiparous women were recruited and randomized either music group (n=80) or a control group (n=81). Women in the music group listened to self-selected music during labor. Postpartum pain intensity, anxiety level and satisfaction rate were measured using the visual analog scale (VAS), postpartum depression rate was assessed with Edinburg Postpartum Depression Scale (EPDS) at postpartum day one and day eight. Results: Mothers in the music therapy group had a lower level of postpartum pain and anxiety than the control group and it was statistically significant at all time intervals (1, 4, 8, 16 and 24h, p<0.001). A significant difference was observed between the two groups in terms of satisfaction rate (p<0.001) and postpartum depression rate at postpartum day one and day eight (p<0.05). Limitations: We only measured the effect of music therapy on early postpartum depression rate. Effect of music on late postpartum depression rate should be investigated in future. Conclusions: Using music therapy during labor decreased postpartum anxiety and pain, increased the satisfaction with childbirth and reduced early postpartum depression rate. Music therapy can be clinically recommended as an alternative, safe, easy and enjoyable nonpharmacological method for postpartum well-being."

Sixty-four women who were planning to have a cesarean delivery were randomly divided into an experimental and a control group. The experimental group received routine care and music therapy, whereas the control group received routine care only. Our results indicated that compared to the control group the experimental group had significantly lower anxiety and a higher level of satisfaction regarding the cesarean experience. No significant differences were found between the two groups in any of the physiological indexes. This controlled study provides evidence that music therapy can reduce anxiety and create a more satisfying experience for women undergoing cesarean delivery."

With the development of a holistic approach, midwives have become continuous support during pregnancy and childbirth. Childbirth education is an intervention that affects delivery outcomes and the experience of childbirth. Music therapy has been proven to be a safe and effective non - pharmacological method to gain in pregnancy and puerperium. The study aimed to prove the impact of educating pregnant women and listening to classical music on the experience of childbirth pains and the occurrence of psychological symptoms during puerperium. Methods: A prospective randomized controlled trial (n=198) was conducted. The experimental group of pregnant women was educated during pregnancy and listened to classical music the rest of the pregnancy, while the control group received the usual care. The VAS scale was used to assess pain, and the 90 - point scale was used to assess the incidence of psychological symptoms. Results: The difference in pain assessment between the experimental and control groups was significant (p<0.001). The experimental group rated their childbirth pain as moderate (M=5.98), while the control group experienced severe pain (M=8.42). A significant difference in the incidence of psychological symptoms between groups was found in the dimensions of interpersonal sensitivity, hostility, phobic anxiety, and paranoid ideations (p=0.042; p=0.014; p=0.013; p=0.008). Conclusion: This study demonstrated the impact of midwifery education and listening to classical music on the perception of childbirth pain and mental health in the puerperium. The experimental group rated childbirth pain significantly lower compared to the control group and had significantly fewer psychological symptoms 6 weeks after delivery."

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of music on labor pain and anxiety, maternal hemodynamics, fetal-neonatal parameters and postpartum analgesic requirement in primiparous women. Methods: Overall, 156 primiparous women who expected vaginal delivery were recruited and randomly assigned to a music group (n = 77) or a control group (n = 79). Women in the music group listened to music during labor. Pain intensity and anxiety level were measured using a visual analogue scale (0-10 cm). The two groups were compared in terms of pain severity, anxiety level, maternal hemodynamics, fetal-neonatal parameters and postpartum analgesic requirement. Results: Mothers in the music therapy group had a lower level of pain and anxiety compared with those in the control group at all stages of labor (p < 0.001). A signiﬁcant difference was observed between the two groups in terms of maternal hemodynamics and fetal heart rate after intervention (p < 0.01). Postpartum analgesic requirement significantly decreased in the music therapy group (p < 0.01). Conclusion: Listening to music during labor has a positive impact on labor pain and anxiety, maternal-fetal parameters and analgesic requirement."

In the present study, we compared the effect of two types of non-pharmacological pain relief methods \"music therapy\" and \"Hoku point ice massage\" on the severity of labor pain. Methods: This prospective, randomized, controlled trial was conducted in Shahrekord, Iran, from September 2013 to June 2014. We randomly assigned 90 primiparous women who expected a normal childbirth into three groups: group \"A\" received music therapy, group \"B\" received Hoku point ice massage, and group \"C\" received usual labor care. At the beginning of the active phase (4 cm cervical dilation) and before and after each intervention (at dilations 4, 6, and 8 cm), the intensities of labor pain were measured using Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). Results: At the beginning of the active phase, the mean VAS scores were 5.58 ± 1.29, 5.42 ± 1.31, and 6.13 ± 1.37 in the women in groups \"A,\" \"B,\" and \"C,\" respectively (P > 0.05). After the intervention, the mean pain scores were significantly lower at all of the time points in groups \"A\" and \"B\" than in group \"C\" women (P < 0.05). Although the pain scores showed a more decreasing trend after the intervention in group \"A\" than that in group \"B,\" the difference between the two groups was not statistically significant (P > 0.05). Conclusions: Music therapy and Hoku point ice massage are easily available and inexpensive methods and have a similar effect in relieving labor pain."

Literature databases were searched from inception to May 2021, and research was expanded through the screening of previous systematic reviews. Inclusion criteria were: (1) population: women in first stage of labor; (2) intervention: non-pharmacological, non-invasive, or minimally invasive intrapartum analgesic techniques alternative and\/or complementary to pharmacological analgesia; (3) comparison: routine intrapartum care or placebos; (4) outcomes: subjective pain intensity; and (5) study design: randomized controlled trial. Risk of bias of included studies was investigated, data analysis was performed using R version 3.5.1. Effect size was calculated as difference between the control and experimental groups at posttreatment in terms of mean pain score. A total of 63 studies were included, for a total of 6146 patients (3468 in the experimental groups and 2678 in the control groups). Techniques included were massage (n = 11), birth balls (n = 5) mind-body interventions (n = 8), heat application (n = 12), music therapy (n = 9), dance therapy (n = 2), acupressure (n = 16), and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) (n = 8). The present review found significant evidence in support of the use of complementary and alternative medicine for labor analgesia, and different methods showed different impact. However, more high-quality trials are needed."

This systematic review investigated the effects of music therapy on postpartum anxiety and pain levels. Methods: English databases including Cochrane, Medline, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed and Persian databases including Scientific Information Database (SID) and the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials (IRCT) were searched. The data were analyzed in RevMan 5.3 and reported as forest plots. The present study was conducted on postpartum women (i.e., the participants). All randomized controlled trials comparing the effects of music (i.e., the intervention) and placebo or routine care (i.e., the control) on postpartum anxiety and pain (i.e., the outcome) were included in the study. Results: Out of a total of 60 retrieved articles, four eligible articles were selected and entered the meta-analysis process. According to the results, anxiety (MD=-0.68, 95% CI=-1.90 to -0.54, P < 0.001) and pain (MD=-1.85, 95% CI=-3.96 to 0.26, P < 0.001) levels of patients in the music therapy group were reduced more significantly than those in the control group. Conclusion: The results showed that music therapy can significantly reduce both postpartum anxiety and pain scores. However, due to the high heterogeneity of the studies, more randomized trials using a standard tool such as the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement are needed."

        "Abstract":"Background and aims: Primiparous women experience high levels of anxiety before cesarean section. Therefore, this research aimed to investigate the effects of the Benson Relaxation Technique (BRT) and Music Therapy (MT) on the anxiety of primiparous women prior to cesarean section. Methods: A randomized controlled trial was carried out on 105 women scheduled for cesarean section. They were randomly assigned into three groups: BRT, MT, and control (n = 35 per group). The women in the BRT and MT groups performed exercises and listened to music, respectively, for 20 minutes prior to cesarean section. The State Anxiety Inventory was used to measure the women's anxiety in the groups before and after the intervention. Results: Within-group comparisons showed that the women in the BRT (t = 5.61, p < 0.001, effect size (Cohen's d) = 0.94) and MT (t = 3.83, p = 0.001, d = 0.64) groups had significantly lower anxiety after the interventions compared to before the interventions. Also, between-group comparisons revealed that anxiety after the intervention was significantly lower in the BRT and MT groups compared to the control group (p = 0.007). Conclusions: Although both of the BRT and MT helped with the reduction of anxiety among primiparous women before cesarean section, the BRT was shown more effective. These nonpharmacologic methods are safe and cost-effective and can improve well-being among women undergoing this invasive procedure. They can be used along with pharmacologic methods for reducing overreliance on medications."

In this prospective, open-label study, we evaluated the effect of listening to a set of Mozart's compositions, according to the Tomatis method, on sleep quality and behavioral disorders, including auto-\/hetero-aggression, irritability, and hyperactivity, in a group of children and adolescents with drug-resistant epilepsy. The study group was composed of 11 outpatients (7 males and 4 females), between 1.5years and 21years of age (mean age: 11.9years), all suffering from drug-resistant epileptic encephalopathy (n=11). All of them had a severe\/profound intellectual disability associated with cerebral palsy. During the study period, each patient had to listen to a set of Mozart's compositions 2h per day for fifteen days for a total of 30h, which could be distributed over the day depending on the habits and compliance of each patient. The music was filtered by a device preferably delivering higher sound frequencies (>3000Hz) according to the Tomatis principles. The antiepileptic drug therapy remained unchanged throughout the study period. During the 15-day music therapy, 2 out of 11 patients had a reduction of 50-75% in seizure recurrence, and 3 out of 12 patients had a reduction of 75-89%. Overall, 5 (45.4%) out of 11 patients had a ≥50% reduction in the total number of seizures, while the percentage decrease of the total seizure number (11\/11) compared with baseline was -51.5% during the 15-day music therapy and -20.7% in the two weeks after the end of treatment. All responders also had an improvement in nighttime sleep and daytime behavior."

Patients and methods: The study comprised 400 patients from three hospitals. Half of patients listened to music during their first SWL session but not during their second session. The other half had no music for the first session but the second session was accompanied by music. During all sessions, with and without music, pulse rates, blood pressure, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-State Anxiety scores (STAI-SA), Visual Analog Scale (VAS scores for pain), willingness to repeat procedure (0 = never to 4 happily), and patient satisfaction rates (0 = poor to 4 = excellent) were assessed. Results: There was no statistical difference between the two groups in terms of blood pressure and pulse rates. In both groups, the STAI-SA and VAS pain scores were lower in the session when music was listened to (p < 0.001). The patients requested more SWL treatment be completed while listening to music and their satisfaction was greater. Conclusion: Music lowered the anxiety and pain scores of patients during SWL and provided greater satisfaction with treatment. Completing this procedure while the patient listens to music increases patient compliance greatly and reduces analgesic requirements."

Patients and methods: Patients with renal calculi scheduled for SWL were prospectively enrolled. All 89 patients between the ages of 19 and 80 years were informed about this study and then randomized into three groups: Group 1 (controls), no headphones and music; Group 2, music with NCHs (patients listened to Turkish classical music with NCHs during SWL); and Group 3, music with non-NCHs (patients listened to Turkish classical music with non-NCHs during SWL). Hemodynamic and respiratory parameters were recorded before and just after the SWL session. All patient visual analog scale (VAS) and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) scores were recorded just after the SWL procedure. Results: There were significant differences in VAS scores among the groups (5.1, 3.6, and 4.5, respectively, p < 0.001), including between Groups 2 and 3 (p = 0.018). There were also significant differences in STAI-State anxiety scores among the groups (43.1, 33.5, and 38.9, respectively, p = 0.001), including between Groups 2 and 3 (p = 0.04). Conclusions: Music therapy during SWL reduced pain and anxiety. Music therapy with NCHs was more effective for pain and anxiety reduction. To reduce pain and anxiety, nonpharmacologic therapies such as music therapy with NCHs during SWL should be investigated further and used routinely."

Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to explore the efficacy of music therapy in reducing pain and anxiety in patients undergoing ESWL. PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, EBSCO, and Cochrane library databases (updated March 2020) were searched for randomized controlled trials assessing music therapy in reducing pain and anxiety in patients undergoing ESWL. The search strategy and study selection process were managed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis statement. Results: Five randomized controlled trials were included in the meta-analysis. Overall, music intervention groups experienced significant reductions in pain (risk ratios = -1.20, 95% confidence intervals = -1.95 to -0.45, P = .002) and anxiety (risk ratios = -3.31, 95% confidence intervals = -4.97 to -1.84, P < .0001) compared with control groups during ESWL. Music therapy gave patient more satisfaction with the treatment and a willingness to repeat the therapy was reported. However, there was no significant difference in the stone clearance rate. Conclusions: Listening to music can reduce patient's pain and anxiety significantly with increased therapy satisfaction and willingness to repeat."

This study aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the effect of listening to music on sleep quality in older adults. Design: Systematic review and meta-analyses. Setting: Five databases, including Embase, Ovid Medline, Cochrane Library, Scopus, and the Index to Taiwan Periodical Literature System, were searched to identify studies assessing the efficacy of music therapy in older adults aged 60 years and older published through February 20, 2021. Participants: Adults aged 60 years and older. Measurements: We searched English- and Chinese-language studies of randomized control trials. All studies were reviewed by two independent investigators. The primary sleep outcome was the Pittsburgh sleep quality index. The Cochrane Collaboration tool was used to assess the risk of bias, and Review Manager 5.3 software was used to conduct the meta-analysis. Results: Five randomized control trials were included in the meta-analysis. Older adults who listened to music experienced significantly better sleep quality than those who did not listen to music [mean difference (MD): -1.96, 95% CI -2.23 to -1.73, P = 0.003]. The subgroup analysis revealed that older adults who listened to sedative music obtained a more effective improvement in sleep quality than those who listened to rhythm-centered music (MD: -2.35, 95% CI -3.59 to -1.10, P = 0.0002). Furthermore, listening to music for longer than 4 weeks (MD: -2.61, 95% CI -4.72 to -0.50, P = 0.02) was to be effective at improving sleep quality. Conclusions: Music therapy is safe and easy to administer and can effectively improve sleep quality among older adults, particularly those listening to more sedative music for at least a four-week duration."

However, the effect of music therapy on improving anxiety, depression, and sleep quality in intensive care unit (ICU) patients remains unclear. This meta-analysis aims to evaluate the effect of music therapy on improving anxiety, depression, and sleep quality in ICU patients, thus providing evidences to support music therapy as a novel complementary alternative therapy. Methods: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) reporting the efficacy of music therapy on improving anxiety, depression and sleep quality in ICU patients published before January 2022 will be searched in online databases, including the PubMed, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Embase, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, VIP Database, and WanFang Database. Literature screening, data extraction, and evaluation of risk of bias will be independently performed by two investigators. Meta-analysis will be performed using Stata 14.0 software. Results: The results of this meta-analysis will be submitted to a peer-reviewed journal for publication. Conclusion: This study will provide reliable evidence-based evidence for the effect of music therapy on anxiety, depression, and sleep quality in ICU patients. Ethics and dissemination: Ethical approval was not required for this study. The systematic review will be published in a peer-reviewed journal, presented at conferences, and shared on social media platforms. Osf registration number: DOI 10.17605\/OSF.IO\/EXAZ6."

This method is usually adopted at our department. Data on the Euterpe method music are still unpublished. The method uses sounds, together with multiple types of sensory stimulation. Each sense is involved: hearing by sound; vision by lights, placed in the therapy room; smell by aroma diffusers; and touch by the tuning fork and vibrating devices. The stimulations can be modified according to the different needs of the patients and to the specific therapeutic targets. During each session, the therapist chooses which senses must be excluded, reinforced or added.",

        "Abstract":"Introduction: During the COVID-19 pandemic, children with neurodevelopmental disabilities could not attend their usual rehabilitation therapies, with a consequent reduced support of developmental process and risk of worsening of their clinical conditions. Methods: We prospectively enrolled 14 children with developmental delay, who had already tried a personalised music therapy (Euterpe method). We included them in a 12-day programme of home-based music therapy. The children and their parents were investigated using the Sleep Disturbance Scale for Children and the Parent Stress Index-Short Form. Results: Fourteen children started the intervention, while only 12 children completed all the planned home sessions and assessments. We observed a significant improvement in children's sleep quality and a reduction of parental distress. Discussion: The significant improvements in parental distress and sleep quality must be considered important achievements for the quality of life of a child and their family. Home-based music therapy can provide a feasible approach to improving sleep and parent's stress for children with developmental disorders."

        "Abstract":"Objective: Idiopathic chronic fatigue (ICF), defined as medically unexplained chronic fatigue, is common these days. To date, there is no definite cure for ICF, and alternative therapies are being investigated. Oriental medicine music therapy (OMMT), a novel music therapy that occurs through an active behavioral process, has been applied to various chronic diseases, including ICF. In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the effect of OMMT on ICF. Design: Randomized controlled trial of OMMT compared with the waitlist control (6 sessions each) during a 2-week period. Participants: Thirty participants who had had ICF for at least 6 months before the experiments were recruited. Outcome measures: We evaluated fatigue severity scale (FSS), visual analog scale (VAS) for overall fatigue, revised Chalder fatigue scale (RCFS), World Health Organization quality of life scale abbreviated version (WHOQOL-BREF), Buzhongyiqi-Tang questionnaire (BZTQ), and salivary cortisol level at baseline (week 0) and at the end of the study (week 2) in the two groups. Results: FSS, VAS, and RCFS scores were significantly lower, and WHOQOL-BREF scores were significantly higher in the OMMT group than in the waitlist group (p=0.006, p=0.004, p=0.002, and p=0.002, respectively). In contrast, salivary cortisol level and BZTQ scores were not significantly different between the OMMT group and the waitlist group. Conclusions: The present study suggests that OMMT may be an alternative treatment for ICF. Based on this result, further studies including possible mechanisms are needed."

        "Abstract":"Background: Music therapy (MT) has been shown to improve outcomes for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) and patients with hematologic and\/or oncologic conditions excluding SCD (HemOnc) in prior randomized trials. While few studies have described the clinical delivery (ie, volume, clinical settings, patient characteristics, referrals, and session characteristics) of MT and examined its real-world effectiveness, no studies have compared responses between hematology\/oncology populations. The purpose of this study was to examine the clinical delivery and effectiveness of MT at a freestanding academic cancer center and compare the effectiveness of MT on pain, anxiety, and fatigue between adult patients in the HemOnc and SCD groups. Methods: A retrospective review was conducted of all MT sessions provided at a freestanding academic cancer center between January 2017 and July 2020. The unadjusted single-session effects of MT on pain, anxiety, and fatigue were assessed among patients reporting symptoms ≥1 out of 10 on a 0 to 10 scale. Adjustments were made for multiple sessions on the same patient using a mixed model to compare pre-session and change scores between the HemOnc and SCD groups. Patients' comments were analyzed using conventional qualitative content analysis. Results: Music therapists provided 4002 sessions to 1152 patients including 1012 in the HemOnc group and 140 in the SCD group. In the combined sample, statistically significant reductions in pain (1.48 units), anxiety (2.58 units), and fatigue (0.84 units) were observed, with changes in pain and anxiety exceeding clinically significant thresholds. After adjustment, the SCD group reported significantly greater pre-session pain (7.22 vs 5.81) and anxiety (6.11 vs 5.17) as well as greater anxiety reduction (2.89 vs 2.23) than the HemOnc group. Patients' comments contained themes including enjoyment, gratitude, and improvements in mood, pain, and anxiety. Conclusions: This study supports the delivery and clinical effectiveness of MT for addressing the needs of patients throughout their course of treatment at an academic cancer center and justifies the inclusion of individuals with SCD within integrative oncology services."

        "Abstract":"Objectives: Not all patients with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) respond to cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). Literature suggests group music therapy might be beneficial in treating PTSD. However, feasibility and effectiveness have not been assessed. The study objectives were to assess whether group music therapy was feasible for patients who did not respond to CBT, and whether it has an effect on PTSD symptoms and depression. Design: The study employed mixed methods comprising of an exploratory randomized controlled trial, qualitative content analysis of therapy, and patient interviews. Method: Patients with significant PTSD symptoms (n = 17) following completion of CBT were randomly assigned to treatment (n = 9) or control groups (n = 8). The treatment group received 10 weeks of group music therapy after which exit interviews were conducted. Control group patients were offered the intervention at the end of the study. Symptoms were assessed on the Impact of Events Scale-Revised and Beck Depression Inventory II at the beginning and end of treatment. Results: Treatment-group patients experienced a significant reduction in severity of PTSD symptoms (-20.18; 95% confidence interval [CI]: [-31.23, -9.12]) and a marginally significant reduction in depression (-11.92; 95%CI: [-24.05, 0.21]) at 10 weeks from baseline compared to the control. Patients viewed music therapy as helpful and reported experiences concur with current literature. Conclusions: Group music therapy appears feasible and effective for PTSD patients who have not sufficiently responded to CBT. Limitations include the small sample size and lack of blinding. Further research should address these limitations, test sustainability, and identify specific factors that address symptoms in treatment."

        "Abstract":"Background: Previous studies have highlighted the potential therapeutic benefits of music therapy as an adjunct to standard care, in a variety of psychiatric ailments including mood and anxiety disorders. However, the role of music in the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) have not been investigated to date. Methods: In a single-center, parallel-group, randomized clinical trial (NCT02314195) 30 patients with OCD were randomly assigned to standard treatment (pharmacotherapy and cognitive-behavior therapy) plus 12 sessions of individual music therapy (n = 15) or standard treatment only (n = 15) for one month. Maudsley Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory, Beck Anxiety Inventory, and Beck Depression Inventory-Short Form were administered baseline and after one month. Results: Thirty patients completed the study. Music therapy resulted in a greater decrease in total obsessive score (post-intervention score: music therapy+standard treatment: 12.4 ± 1.9 vs standard treatment only: 15.1 ± 1.7, p < 0.001, effect size = 56.7%). For subtypes, significant between-group differences were identified for checking (p = 0.004), and slowness (p = 0.019), but not for washing or responsibility. Music therapy was significantly more effective in reducing anxiety (post-intervention score: music therapy + standard treatment: 16.9 ± 7.4 vs standard treatment only: 22.9 ± 4.6, p < 0.001, effect size = 47.0%), and depressive symptoms (post-intervention score: music therapy + standard treatment: 10.8 ± 3.8 vs standard treatment: 17.1 ± 3.7, p < 0.001, effect size = 47.0%). Limitations: Inclusion of a small sample size, lack of blinding due to the nature of the intervention, short duration of follow-up. Conclusion: In patients with OCD, music therapy, as an adjunct to standard care, seems to be effective in reducing obsessions, as well as co-morbid anxiety and depressive symptoms."

They lack reference to emotions and their connection to social skills and they don't deal with group dynamics and its impact on the group. We conducted a preliminary examination of the \"Ensemble\" treatment, which was developed to improve the social skills of children of various client populations, with the social deficiency originating from different sources; (2) Methods: 24 children in four groups went through the year-long \"Ensemble\" treatment. Observations of the sessions were analyzed quantitatively counting the occurrence of twelve typical socially oriented behaviors. Qualitative interviews were conducted with 24 mothers and 23 kindergarten teachers (KTs) before and after the process; (3) Results: Quantitative results show that children in all four \"Ensemble\" groups, improved in nine out of twelve social skills. Qualitative results show that the improvement was evident also in the home environment (as reported by mothers) and in the kindergarten environment (as reported by KTs); (4) Conclusions: A comparison between the \"Ensemble\" and previous music therapy treatments indicates this treatment's potential to help children with a wide variety of social skill deficiencies. Further investigation based on more rigorous research designs is recommended."

        "Abstract":"Singing, as a method of combining respiratory function exercise and vocal intonation therapy, provides a new direction for respiratory function exercise in patients with spinal cord injury. This randomized controlled trial investigated the effects of oral motor respiratory exercise and vocal intonation therapy on respiratory function and vocal quality in patients with spinal cord injury. Among 31 included patients with spinal cord injury, 18 completed the treatment. These 18 patients were randomly assigned to undergo music therapy (intervention group, 30 min\/d, 5 times a week, for a total of 12 weeks; n = 9, 7 males and 2 females; 30.33 ± 11.74 years old) or normal respiratory training (control group, n = 9; 8 males and 1 female; 34.78 ± 11.13 years old). Both patient groups received routine treatment concurrently. Before and at 6 and 12 weeks after intervention, a standard respiratory function test, a voice test, the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire, and a quality of life questionnaire were administered. The results showed that the inspiratory capacity, forced expiratory volume in 1 second, forced vital capacity, maximal mid-expiratory flow rate, sing-loud pressure level, and sustained note length were significantly increased in the intervention group compared with the control group. The St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire and quality of life results of patients in the intervention group were significantly superior to those in the control group. These findings suggest that oral motor respiratory exercise and vocal intonation therapy, as respiratory training methods in music therapy, are effective and valuable for improving respiratory dysfunction and vocal quality in patients with spinal cord injury. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of China Rehabilitation Research Center (approval No. 2019-78-1) on May 27, 2019 and was registered with the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (registration number: ChiCTR1900026922) on October 26, 2019."

        "Abstract":"In previous studies, researchers have used singing to treat respiratory function in patients with spinal cord injury. However, few studies have examined the way in which vocal training affects respiratory neural plasticity in patients with spinal cord injury. Vocal respiratory training (VRT) is a type of vocal muscle-related treatment that is often a component of music therapy (MT) and focuses on strengthening respiratory muscles and improving lung function. In this randomized controlled study, we analyzed the therapeutic effects of VRT on respiratory dysfunction at 3 months after cervical spinal cord injury. Of an initial group of 37 patients, 26 completed the music therapy intervention, which comprised five 30-minute sessions per week for 12 weeks. The intervention group (n = 13) received VRT training delivered by professional certified music therapists. The control group (n = 13) received respiratory physical therapy delivered by professional physical therapists. Compared with the control group, we observed a substantial increase in respiratory function in the intervention group after the 12-week intervention. Further, the nerve fiber bundles in the respiratory center in the medulla exhibited a trend towards increased diversification, with an increased number, path length, thickness, and density of nerve fiber bundles. These findings provide strong evidence for the effect of music therapeutic VRT on neural plasticity. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of China Rehabilitation Research Center (approval No. 2020-013-1) on April 1, 2020, and was registered with the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (registration No. ChiCTR2000037871) on September 2, 2020."

Objective: The purpose of this randomized pilot study was to evaluate the effects of music therapy in the form of patient-preferred live music (PPLM) on fatigue, energy and pain in adults hospitalized on a blood and marrow transplant (BMT) unit. Method: Participants (n = 35) were randomly assigned to an experimental or wait-list control group and completed the Lee Fatigue Scale and a 10-point Likert-type pain scale at pre- and posttest. Results: Between-group posttest results were statistically significant for fatigue and pain, with the experimental group having less fatigue and pain than the control group. Conclusions: PPLM can be a preferred and effective intervention to immediately lessen fatigue and pain without pharmacological intervention. Implications for clinical practice, limitations and suggestions for future research are provided."

The procedure causes significant psychological distress and no interventions have been demonstrated to improve mood in these patients. Music therapy has been shown to improve anxiety in a variety of acute medical settings. In the current study, the authors determined the effects of music therapy compared with standard care on mood during inpatient stays for HDT\/ASCT. Methods: Patients with hematologic malignancy admitted for HDT\/ASCT at two sites (Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and Ireland Cancer Center in Cleveland, Ohio) were randomized to receive music therapy given by trained music therapists or standard care. Outcome was assessed at baseline and every 3 days after randomization using the Profile of Mood States. Results: Of 69 patients registered in the study, follow-up data were available for 62 (90%). During their inpatient stay, patients in the music therapy group scored 28% lower on the combined Anxiety\/Depression scale (P = 0.065) and 37% lower (P = 0.01) on the total mood disturbance score compared with controls. Conclusions: Music therapy is a noninvasive and inexpensive intervention that appears to reduce mood disturbance in patients undergoing HDT\/ASCT."

Methods: The present pragmatic quasi-randomized controlled clinical trial was conducted on 130 patients undergone elective angiography. The participants were randomly divided into two groups, including a pleasant natural sounds group, and a control group (n1\/2 65 per group). Spielberger's state\/trait anxiety inventory was used to assess levels of anxiety. The patients' anxiety level and physiological parameters were measured at baseline, before, during, immediately after, and 20 min after coronary angiography. Results: The mean level of anxiety was similar in both arms at baseline (t = 1.317, df = 128, p = 0.190). The intervention arm displayed significantly lower anxiety levels than the control arm during the intervention (Wilks' lambda 0.11, Pillai's trace 0.89, P 0.001, F 2.05). The physiological parameters (systolic and diastolic blood pressure, mean arterial pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation) of both groups showed statistically significant differences (p < 0.05) over time and in group-by time interactions. Conclusion: As an effective nursing intervention presenting no side-effects, listening to pleasant natural sounds can be helpful in the management of anxiety."

Best corrected visual acuity, intraocular pressure, visual field testing, short- and long-term mental states, and blood levels of different stress hormones were analyzed and compared. Results: A total of 25 (61%)\/16 (39%) patients were assigned to the TG\/CG. Best corrected visual acuity, daily intraocular pressure, and short-term mental state (KAB) development were significantly better in the TG in comparison to controls. Visual field testing, long-term mental well-being (profile of mood states), and adrenalin, cortisol, and endothelin-I blood levels did not differ significantly between both groups. Conclusion: Additive RM applied on a daily basis can positively impact various physiological and psychological parameters in the short term."

Moreover, caregivers of patients with RTT face stressors related to patients' medical and developmental concerns. Given the indications from case reports, this pilot study investigated the effectiveness of music therapy on RTT patients, as well as on parental stress for families of children with RTT. Methods: Families in the study group were enrolled in a twice-weekly 120-minute music therapy program for 24 weeks (n = 11), whereas families in the control group did not receive music therapy (n = 12). Participants were administered the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, Rett Syndrome Clinical Severity Scale, Rett Syndrome Motor Behavioral Assessment, and Parenting Stress Index for caregivers of RTT children before and after the music therapy program. Results: Music therapy improved receptive language, verbal and non-verbal communication skills, and social interaction for RTT patients. In addition, purposeful hand function, breathing patterns, and eye contact were significantly improved. Of note, music therapy also decreased the frequency of epileptic seizures. Lastly, caregivers in the study group exhibited significantly lower stress following the program. Conclusion: The 24-week music therapy program was effective in improving social interaction, communication skills, eye contact, hand function, and reducing seizure frequency among RTT patients. Additionally, music therapy was effective in relieving parenting stress, which may help healthcare providers initiate early intervention strategies that can prevent parenting stress and reduce the risk of depression."

        "Abstract":"Williams syndrome (WS) is a genetic disorder characterized by intellectual delay and an affinity for music. It has been previously shown that familiar music can enhance verbal memory in individuals with WS who have had music training. There is also evidence that unfamiliar, or novel, music may also improve cognitive recall. This study was designed to examine if a novel melody could also enhance verbal memory in individuals with WS, and to more fully characterize music training in this population. We presented spoken or sung sentences that described an animal and its group name to 44 individuals with WS, and then tested their immediate and delayed memory using both recall and multiple choice formats. Those with formal music training (average duration of training 4½ years) scored significantly higher on both the spoken and sung recall items, as well as on the spoken multiple choice items, than those with no music training. Music therapy, music enjoyment, age, and Verbal IQ did not impact performance on the memory tasks. These findings provide further evidence that formal music lessons may impact the neurological pathways associated with verbal memory in individuals with WS, consistent with findings in typically developing individuals."

        "Abstract":"Recent research found evidence supporting music therapy for children with neurological diseases during their hospitalized neurological early rehabilitation to promote their development during physical therapy. We hypothesized that live music therapy might improve vital signs during a physical therapy session. Seventeen children received live music therapy during the physical therapy session twice a week. Two more physical therapy sessions per week were held without music therapy. Heart rate, respiratory rate and oxygen saturation were recorded from 15 min before to 15 min after the therapy sessions. Physical therapy interventions showed changes in heart rate, respiratory rate and oxygen saturation between, before and after the sessions with or without music therapy. Live music therapy was effective for the vital signs during the intervention. We observed significantly lower heart and respiratory rates and higher oxygen saturation during physical therapy intervention with live music therapy in general (mean differences -8.0 beats per min; -0.8 breaths per min and +0.6%). When physical therapy was applied without music therapy children's heart rates increased by 8.5 beats per min and respiratory rates increased by 1.0 breaths per min. Live music therapy leads to a decrease in heart and respiratory rates and an increase in oxygen saturation in children with neurological diseases during physical therapy with live music therapy. Music therapy supports the children in physical therapy interventions during their hospitalization."

Methods: This study is designed based on randomization method. A total of 36 subjects participated in the experiment, consisting of an ADHD control group (n = 18) and ADHD music therapy group (n = 18). The ADHD control group received standard care, while the ADHD music therapy group received music therapy and standard care. The ADHD music therapy group received both active music therapy (improvisation) and receptive music therapy (music listening) for 50 minutes, twice a week, for 3 months: a total of 24 times. From a neurophysiological perspective, changes in depression and stress were tracked by measuring 5-HT secretion, cortisol expression, blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), and CDI and DHQ psychological scales. Results: The ADHD music therapy group's 5-HT secretion increased (p < 0.001), whereas cortisol expression (p < 0.001), BP (p < 0.001) and HR (p < 0.001) decreased. The CDI and DHQ psychological scales also showed positive changes (p < 0.01 and p < 0.001, respectively). However, the ADHD Con G's (who did not receive music therapy) 5-HT secretion did not increase, whereas cortisol expression, BP, and HR did not decrease. In addition, the CDI and DHQ psychological scales did not display positive changes. Conclusions: In conclusion, the application of music therapy as an alternative treatment for ADHD children and adolescents showed positive neurophysiological and psychological effects. Therefore, this study would like to propose a new alternative to medicine for preventing and treating depression through various uses of music therapy."

The aim of the study was to determine whether group music therapy (GMT) positively impacted on quality of life (QoL), social enrichment, self-esteem, spirituality and psychiatric symptoms of participants with SMI and how they experienced the intervention. Method: The primary outcome was QoL; secondary measures assessed social enrichment, self-esteem, spirituality and psychiatric symptoms. The 13-week intervention comprised singing familiar songs and composing original songs recorded in a professional studio. Qualitative data were generated from focus group interviews and song lyric analysis. Results: Ninety-nine adults (57 female) were recruited, with an initial cohort (n = 75) randomized to either: weekly GMT followed by standard care (SC) or SC followed by GMT. Crossover occurred after 13 weeks. Measures were conducted at baseline, 13, 26 and 39 weeks. A second cohort (n = 24) could not be randomized and were assigned to GMT followed by SC. Intention-to-treat analysis showed a significant difference between GMT and SC on QoL and spirituality. This was robust to different assumptions about missing data (listwise deletion, last observation carried forward or multiple imputation). Per-protocol analysis suggested greater benefit for those receiving more sessions. Focus group interview and song lyric analyses suggested that GMT was enjoyable; self-esteem was enhanced; participants appreciated therapists and peers; and although challenges were experienced, the programme was recommended to others. Conclusion: Group music therapy may enhance QoL and spirituality of persons with SMI."

However, interventions using music creation as their core await further development for patients with severe mental illness (SMI). The current study investigated the effect of a music-creation programme on the anxiety, self-esteem, and quality of life of patients with SMI. A quasi-experimental design using convenience sampling was adopted to recruit patients with SMI from a psychiatric day care centre. Participants were grouped based on their willingness to undergo an intervention (26 patients in the experimental group and 23 patients in the control group). The control groups participated in conventional mental rehabilitation therapy activities. The experimental group participated in a music-creation session for 90 min every week over a 32-week period. The outcome indicators before and after the intervention were assessed using the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A), Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES), and World Health Organization Quality of Life-BREF (WHOQOL-BREF). Finally, the intervention effect was determined using generalized estimating equations (GEEs). After 32 weeks of intervention activities, the experimental group showed significant improvements in their HAM-A total scores (P < 0.001) and RSES total scores (P = 0.005). Regarding quality of life, the improvements of the experimental group in terms of the psychological (P = 0.016) and social relationship domains (P = 0.033) were superior to those of the control group. Music-creation programmes are recommended for inclusion in the routine rehabilitation activities of patients with SMI."

        "Publication_Year":"2010",
        "Abstract":"Background: Language development is one of the most significant processes of early childhood development. Children with delayed speech development are more at risk of acquiring other cognitive, social-emotional, and school-related problems. Music therapy appears to facilitate speech development in children, even within a short period of time. The aim of this pilot study is to explore the effects of music therapy in children with delayed speech development. Methods: A total of 18 children aged 3.5 to 6 years with delayed speech development took part in this observational study in which music therapy and no treatment were compared to demonstrate effectiveness. Individual music therapy was provided on an outpatient basis. An ABAB reversal design with alternations between music therapy and no treatment with an interval of approximately eight weeks between the blocks was chosen. Before and after each study period, a speech development test, a non-verbal intelligence test for children, and music therapy assessment scales were used to evaluate the speech development of the children. Results: Compared to the baseline, we found a positive development in the study group after receiving music therapy. Both phonological capacity and the children's understanding of speech increased under treatment, as well as their cognitive structures, action patterns, and level of intelligence. Throughout the study period, developmental age converged with their biological age. Ratings according to the Nordoff-Robbins scales showed clinically significant changes in the children, namely in the areas of client-therapist relationship and communication. Conclusions: This study suggests that music therapy may have a measurable effect on the speech development of children through the treatment's interactions with fundamental aspects of speech development, including the ability to form and maintain relationships and prosodic abilities. Thus, music therapy may provide a basic and supportive therapy for children with delayed speech development. Further studies should be conducted to investigate the mechanisms of these interactions in greater depth. Trial registration: The trial is registered in the German clinical trials register; Trial-No.: DRKS00000343."

However, there is little research into effective interventions for reducing meal related anxiety in an inpatient setting. Methods: This study compared the levels of distress and anxiety of patients with Anorexia Nervosa pre and post music therapy, in comparison to standard post meal support therapy. Data was collected using the Subjective Units of Distress (SUDS) scale which was administered pre and post each condition. Results: A total of 89 intervention and 84 control sessions were recorded. Results from an unpaired t-test analysis indicated statistically significant differences between the music therapy and supported meal conditions. Conclusions: Results indicated that participation in music therapy significantly decreases post meal related anxiety and distress in comparison to standard post meal support therapy. This research provides support for the use of music therapy in this setting as an effective clinical intervention in reducing meal related anxiety."

        "Abstract":"Literature reviews appear to indicate that Music Therapy (MT) may instil a sense of empowerment and generate feelings of renewed self-confidence, distracting subjects who follow this type of intervention from negative thoughts and, generally, helping patients suffering from Anorexia Nervosa (AN) to redevelop or rediscover their identity. The purpose of the study reported in this paper is to investigate whether MT proposed before an evening meal is capable of decreasing pre-meal anxiety in adolescents suffering from AN who follow the Day-hospital Treatment Programme at the San Bortolo Hospital of Vicenza (Italy). A total of 24 patients participated voluntarily in once-weekly sessions of group-based MT conducted by a qualified music therapist over a period of six months. Before evening meals on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, pre-meal anxiety was measured using a self-report scale, and the MT group session occurred every Wednesday before the evening meal was consumed. MT activities were both active and receptive. It has been found that with respect to Mondays and Tuesdays, pre-meal anxiety was significantly lower on Wednesdays following participation in the MT group. MT is evidently capable of reducing pre-meal anxiety and may be adopted as a supportive element in treatment plans relating to patients with AN in a day-hospital treatment programme."

Design: A randomised controlled study with 114 patients undergoing haemodialysis with a control group (n = 57) and an experimental group (n = 57) who received 30 minutes of live saxophone music therapy. Measurements: Systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate, glycaemia, oxygen saturation, pain, mood and itching levels were measured before and after the live music performance, resulting in baseline and post-test values for the patients in the experimental group. Results: The experimental group showed a statistically significant reduction in pain level, and an improvement in mood and itching levels and in the oxygen saturation. Conclusion: Live saxophone music could be introduced to improve clinical and quality-of-life measures in patients undergoing haemodialysis."

        "Abstract":"Background: Repeated pain during haemodialysis access cannulations is a serious problem for haemodialysis patients even when prescribed oral or topical analgesics. Although some studies have observed the efficacy of music therapy for improving pain and anxiety, its effectiveness during haemodialysis access cannulations during dialysis is uncertain. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of music therapy for pain when cannulating haemodialysis access for haemodialysis patients. Methods: A prospective, multi-facility, single-blind, crossover, randomised controlled trial will be implemented. The intervention includes listening to Mozart, along with a white noise control condition. One hundred twenty haemodialysis patients will be enrolled across five facilities. Patients will be randomly allocated to either an Early-sequence group or a Later-sequence group. The Early-sequence group will receive cannulation while listening to Mozart's Sonata for two pianos in D major (K.448) during the second week (Music period) and white noise during the fourth week (White noise period). The Later-sequence group will receive cannulation along with white noise first, followed by Mozart. All patients will also undergo cannulation during a no-sound period (wearing only headphones) during the first and third week (No-sound period). The music or no-music protocol will begin 8 min prior to the cannulating procedure, and participants will finish listening after starting haemodialysis during each period. The primary outcomes that will be assessed include the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) score for pain during cannulation, and secondary outcomes are blood pressure, heart rate, VAS anxiety score, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory score, and salivary amylase activity. The operators who are in charge of haemodialysis access cannulation will be blind to the listening condition and VAS report. Discussion: The proposed study has several methodological benefits. First, using white noise is a suitable control condition for addressing the role of sound in pain management. Additionally, using a crossover design with repeated measurements can help control individual differences between participants, which should better distinguish between- and within-participant variability. Overall, music therapy is a safe and inexpensive intervention that does not have the problematic side effects typically associated with pharmacological treatment. If effective, music therapy can be easily implemented for reducing pain and anxiety during cannulation. Trial registration: This trial was prospectively registered to UMIN Clinical Trials Registry on 1 July 2018 (UMIN 000032850)."

        "Abstract":"Background: The aim was to evaluate the effects of music on patients' anxiety and satisfaction after undergoing dialysis access procedures under moderate sedation. Methods: Patients (n = 30) undergoing moderate sedation for dialysis access procedures were evaluated at a single institution. Each patient filled out a survey preoperatively and postoperatively using the short form State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-6). Patient-selected music was provided by using a MP3 player with noise canceling headphones. Results: Postoperatively, 77% of patients perceived music intervention as very or extremely helpful in decreasing anxiety during the procedure. Further, 93% of patients were somewhat or very satisfied with their procedure. The average pain rating was 3.1 on a scale of 0-10, in which 70% of patients had no to mild pain and 30% of patients rated moderate to severe pain. In comparison to prior procedures without music, 63% of patients rated better experience with the music intervention, 37% rated a similar experience, and 3.7% rated having a worse experience. Approximately, 93% of patients were willing to repeat procedure with music and would recommend it to other patients. Preoperative anxiety average score was 35.6 ± 13 and was reduced postoperatively to 28.9 ± 12.9 (P = .006). Preoperatively, 23% of patients rated high anxiety and postoperatively only 6.7% of patients rated high anxiety (P = .016). Conclusion: Music is an easy, feasible, inexpensive intervention that may reduce patients' anxiety and improve satisfaction during moderate sedation procedures and in the postoperative period."

This randomized controlled study was conducted with 61 patients (30 patients in the intervention group, 31 patients in the control group) in a province located in Turkey. This 8-week, randomized, clinical trial was carried out in 2 hemodialysis units. After the patients in both groups were informed about the study, the Piper Fatigue Scale and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale were administered to the patients. All subdomain scores of the Piper Fatigue Scale in the intervention group were significantly lower at weeks 4, 8, and 10 than those of the control group (P < .05). The intervention group had significantly lower Anxiety subscale scores than those of the control group at week 10 (P < .05). Similarly, Depression subscale scores were significantly lower in the intervention group at weeks 8 and 10 than those in the control group (P < .05). The findings suggest that Benson relaxation technique combined with music therapy is an effective approach to manage fatigue, anxiety, and depression symptoms related to hemodialysis."

Methods: Patients diagnosed with osteosarcoma were assessed for eligibility. A total of 101 patients were ultimately randomized into the intervention and control groups. Both groups received routine care. Eight sessions of MBSR and MT psychotherapy were conducted in the intervention group, while the control group received no psychological intervention. Patients were assessed regarding pain, anxiety, and sleep quality at two distinct stages: before and after the intervention. Results: There were no significant differences in sociodemographic and clinical parameters between the intervention and control groups at baseline. The intervention program significantly alleviated psychological and physiological complications in patients with osteosarcoma. Specifically, the study revealed that 8 weeks of the combined MBSR\/MT intervention effectively reduced pain and anxiety scores and improved the quality of sleep in patients. Conclusion: MBSR combined with MT significantly alleviated clinical symptoms, and could be considered a new, effective psychotherapeutic intervention for patients with osteosarcoma."

Aims: This evidence-based practice quality improvement project explored the feasibility of implementing a music therapy intervention for improved pain management (pain intensity, analgesic volume) and patient satisfaction among patients with a diagnosis of cirrhotic end-stage liver disease in the acute care setting. Design: The plan-do-check-act cycle served as the implementation framework. Four nurse champions were trained to implement a 30-minute music intervention. Self-selected musical selections were delivered via unit-based iPads with earbud headphones during 3 consecutive days. Methods: Data collection was performed using unit-based measures for pain and patient satisfaction and an investigator-developed audit tool. Bivariate analyses and descriptive statistics were used to assess the effect of the intervention on the three outcomes of interest. Results: Overall results from data collected with eight participants during a 6-week period indicated a 10% reduction in pain intensity and a 30% improvement in patient satisfaction with pain management care. Conclusions: Findings from this evidence-based practice quality improvement project provide support for the effectiveness of music therapy as an adjunct to traditional pharmacologic modalities for pain management of the end-stage liver disease patient population."

        "Abstract":"Background: Pain is a disagreeable and distressing feeling that affects human beings in multi-dimensional ways. A number of non-pharmacological interventions have had varying degrees of success in treating cancer-related pain, such as breathing and relaxation techniques, and music therapy, which have been identified as beneficial therapies for alleviating pain and anxiety. Objective: Identify the therapeutic effects of music interventions in psychological and physiological terms and on the quality of life of children undergoing cancer treatment. Method: Systematic review of effectiveness based on the methodology of the Joanna Briggs Institute. Results: Eleven articles were included with a total of 429 children, whose ages ranged from 0 to 18 years. The mean duration of the music intervention was 30.6 (±SD 9.8) min. In a combined estimate of five studies for pain and anxiety outcomes, there were benefits to using music when compared with the control group (SMD -1.05; CI 95 % -1.70 - 0.40 N = 453 I2 = 90 %). A combined analysis of five studies to assess quality of life showed that the use of music was favorable when compared with the control (SMD -0.80; CI 95 % -1.17-0.43 N = 457= I2 = 71 %). Conclusion: After completing this review, it was determined that there is evidence to support the use of music to reduce pain and anxiety and improve the quality of life of children undergoing cancer treatment."

        "Abstract":"Background: Young children who experience high levels of preoperative anxiety often exhibit distress behaviors, experience more surgical complications, and are at a higher risk for developing a variety of negative postoperative consequences. A significant factor in pediatric preoperative anxiety is the level of anxiety present in their caregivers. Active and passive music therapy interventions addressing anxiety prior to invasive procedures have been met with success. Objective: The purpose of this study was to investigate the comparative effectiveness of two distraction-based music therapy interventions on reducing preoperative anxiety in young pediatric surgical patients and their caregivers. Methods: A total of 40 pediatric patient and caregiver dyads undergoing ambulatory surgery were included in this study. Pediatric preoperative anxiety was measured pre- and post-intervention using the modified Yale Pediatric Anxiety Scale, while caregiver anxiety was measured through self-report using the short-form Strait-Trait Anxiety Inventory-Y6. Participants were randomized to either an active or passive intervention group for a preoperative music therapy session. Results: Results indicated a significant reduction in preoperative anxiety for both patients and their caregivers regardless of intervention type. Neither active nor passive music therapy interventions were significantly more effective than the other. Conclusions: For future studies, the researchers recommend an increased sample size, controlling for various factors such as sedative premedication use, and testing interventions with patients in various stages of development."

Design: This prospective randomized trial enrolled 181 women undergoing embryo transfer, who were randomized to harp therapy during embryo transfer or standard treatment. Patients underwent standardized psychological testing and physiologic assessment of stress. Setting: The study was conducted in a reproductive medicine practice. Results: No statistically significant differences were found in the heart and respiratory rates, nor was there a significant difference in event-based anxiety at baseline. Harp therapy had a significantly larger decrease in state anxiety from pre- to post-embryo transfer. Clinical pregnancy was 53% versus 48% for the harp therapy and standard treatment groups, respectively. Conclusion: Harp therapy decreases state, or event-based, anxiety, significantly lowering state scores posttransfer and having a positive effect on acute levels of stress. There was an increased pregnancy rate, but larger sample sizes are needed to evaluate whether harp therapy has an effect on clinical outcomes."

Design: This was a 1:2 (Music vs Control) randomized controlled study. Setting: A teaching hospital. Patients: One hundred patients were available for the analysis: 30 and 70 in the Music and Control arms, respectively. Interventions: Perioperative music therapy pathway in patients undergoing TLH for benign disease. Measurements and main results: Anxiety was evaluated with the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory Y Form (STAI-Y) at different time points: at baseline and during preoperative, early postoperative, and late postoperative periods. Pathologic anxiety was defined as STAI-Y state >45. Postoperative pain was registered using the visual analog scale. Women in the Music arm experienced lower anxiety levels (median STAI-Y scores 38.0 vs 41.0; p = .002) during the preoperative period. STAI-Y scores did not vary significantly by intervention at each subsequent time point. A significant difference between the groups (Music vs Control) was found in the proportion of women with pathologic anxiety during the preoperative (16.7% vs 37.2%; p = .04) and early postoperative periods (0% vs 12.9%; p = .04), whereas no significant difference between the groups was registered during the late postoperative period (6.6% vs 7.1%; p = .93). Postoperative pain intensity did not significantly differ between the groups at 1, 3, and 6 hours after surgery. Conclusions: Music therapy might be a viable complementary modality to usual surgical care in the gynecologic setting for its ability to significantly decrease preoperative anxiety in women undergoing TLH for benign conditions."

Listening to music is effective in reducing patient anxiety in some endoscopy procedures but has not yet been evaluated in pleural procedures. Aim: To evaluate the benefits of music therapy during pleural procedures on a patient's anxiety, perceived pain and satisfaction with the procedure. Methods: Consecutive patients undergoing therapeutic pleural procedures were randomised to music and control groups. Participants in the music group listened to self-selected music using ear-bud headphones for the duration of the procedure. State anxiety was assessed before and after the procedure using the State Trait Anxiety Inventory. Physiological parameters were also measured. Results: Sixty patients were included in the study. In the music group, a reduction in state anxiety scores were observed post-procedure (34 ± 11 vs 48 ± 13, P < 0.001), while no change was observed in the control group (40 ± 11 vs 42 ± 11, P = 0.51). Participants in the music group had reductions in heart rate (87 ± 17 vs 95 ± 15, P = 0.04), systolic (121 ± 13 vs 130 ± 16, P = 0.02) and diastolic blood pressure (72 ± 8 vs 78 ± 9, P = 0.01) post procedure compared to the pre-procedures values. A similar change was not detected in the control group: heart rate (86 ± 17 vs 85 ± 15, P = 0.73), systolic (133 ± 21 vs 134 ± 20, P = 0.83) and diastolic blood pressure (77 ± 9 vs 79 ± 10, P = 0.30). There was no difference in patient pain scores (P = 0.8), willingness to undergo the procedure again (P= 0.27), satisfaction with the performance of the pleural procedure (P = 0.20) and duration of the procedure (P = 0.68) between the music and control groups. Conclusions: Listening to music appears to be beneficial in reducing anxiety in patients undergoing pleural procedures."

In all, 151 patients undergoing day case surgery for inguinal hernia repair or varicose vein surgery under general anaesthesia were randomly allocated to three groups: group 1 listened to music intra-operatively, group 2 listened to music postoperatively and group 3, the control group, listened to 'white noise'. The anaesthetic and postoperative analgesic techniques were standardised. Pain was assessed using a numeric rating scale (0-10) and patients requirements for postoperative morphine, paracetamol and ibuprofen was recorded. The effect of music on nausea, fatigue and anxiety was also investigated. The results showed that patients exposed to music intra-operatively or postoperatively reported significantly lower pain intensity at 1 and 2 h postoperatively and patients in the postoperative music group required less morphine at 1 h compared to the control group. No differences were noted in the other variables. This study demonstrates that there is a short-term pain-reducing effect of music therapy however, the beneficial effects do not differ if the patient is exposed to music intra-operatively or postoperatively."

        "Abstract":"Patients scheduled for gastrointestinal procedures such as colonoscopy or esophagogastroduodenoscopy are often anxious and frightened. High levels of anxiety may result in more difficult and painful procedures. Past research has reported education, coping skills, relaxation techniques, and combinations of these including music, have decreased anxiety in patients across many settings. Self-selected music therapy for preprocedural anxiety has not been studied. A randomized controlled trial of 198 patients was undertaken to determine whether 15 minutes of self-selected music reduced preprocedure anxiety. The State Trait Anxiety Inventory was used to measure patients' anxiety. One-hundred ninety-three men and 5 women comprised the sample with an average age of 61 (SD 10.5). Patients who listened to music (n = 100) reduced their anxiety score from 36.7 (SD 9.1) to 32.3 (SD 10.4), while those who did not listen to music (n = 98) reduced their anxiety score from 36.1 (SD 8.3) to 34.6 (SD 11.5). These differences were statistically significant (F = 7.5, p =.007) after controlling for trait anxiety. There were no significant vital sign changes premusic and postmusic. Music is a noninvasive nursing intervention that can significantly reduce patients' anxiety prior to gastrointestinal procedures. Further research should address using music to reduce anxiety in other procedure areas and testing effectiveness of self-selected versus investigator-selected music in reducing anxiety."

        "Abstract":"Background: Music is a safe and cost-effective intervention that can reduce postoperative pain and anxiety. We investigated the effects of music therapy on postoperative recovery in patients undergoing robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP). Methods: Subjects were males 18 years and older undergoing RALP at a single tertiary care institution. Patients were randomized to music or control groups. The music group received 30 minutes of music in the recovery area and on postoperative day (POD) 1, while the control group was not provided postoperative music. Inpatient narcotic use (morphine milligram equivalent, or MME) and outpatient narcotic use were measured, and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) survey was completed on POD 1 and POD 7 by an inpatient advanced practitioner (AP). T-test and Chi-square were used to compare the groups. Linear regression was used to adjust for age, blood loss, and inpatient MME. Results: A total of 40 patients were prospectively recruited. There was no statistically significant difference in the hourly MME (2.06 [0.71-3.17] vs. 1.55 [0.83-3.37]) or total MME (49.52 [17-76] vs. 37.25 [20-69]) used in the music vs. non-music arms, respectively. Evaluation of STAI questionnaire revealed no overall differences in anxiety levels among the two groups on POD 1 or POD 7. After adjusting for age, blood loss, and inpatient MME use, patients assigned to the music intervention had a 26% reduction in post-hospitalization use. Conclusion: Our prospective randomized study suggests that music can be an AP-driven adjunct to facilitate postoperative patient comfort and reduce narcotic use upon discharge in prostate cancer patients."

Aims: To examine the effect of a music intervention (MI) on stress hormones, physiologic parameters, pain, and anxiety state before and during port catheter placement procedures (PCPPs). Methods: We conducted a prospective, randomized, controlled study in 100 oncology patients, who were randomly assigned to an MI group (n=50) or a control group (n=50). The effects of music were assessed by determination of serum cortisol and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) levels, heart and respiratory rate (HR, RR) and systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP, DBP), on arrival in the surgical intervention room, as well as immediately prior to and immediately after the PCPP, in both groups. Furthermore, pain and anxiety levels were identified using visual analogue scale and state-trait anxiety inventory scales. Results: On arrival, there were no differences between the patients in terms of serum cortisol and ACTH levels, HR, RR, SBP, DBP and anxiety levels. There were significant reductions in hormone levels (p<0.05 for all), HR (p<0.001), RR (p<0.001), SBP (p<0.05) and DBP (p<0.05), immediately prior to and immediately after the PCPP in participants in the MI group compared to those in the control group. Furthermore, music led to a significant reduction in pain (p<0.05) and anxiety scores (p<0.05) in the MI group compared to control group. Conclusion: During invasive medical procedures, MI significantly decreases stress hormone levels, physiological parameters, acute procedural pain and anxiety."

        "Abstract":"Background and objectives: This randomized controlled trial was designed to evaluate, first, whether intra- or postoperative music therapy could influence stress and immune response during and after general anaesthesia and second, if there was a different response between patients exposed to music intra- or postoperatively. Method: Seventy-five patients undergoing open hernia repair as day care surgery were randomly allocated to three groups: intraoperative music, postoperative music and silence (control group). Anaesthesia and postoperative analgesia were standardized and the same surgeon performed all the operations. Stress response was assessed during and after surgery by determining the plasma cortisol and blood glucose levels. Immune function was evaluated by studying immunoglobulin A (IgA) levels. Patients' postoperative pain, anxiety, blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR) and oxygen saturation were also studied as stress markers. Results: There was a significantly greater decrease in the level of cortisol in the postoperative music group vs. the control group (206 and 72 mmol L(-1) decreases, respectively) after 2 h in the post anaesthesia care unit. The postoperative music group had less anxiety and pain and required less morphine after 1 h compared with the control group. In the postoperative music group the total requirement of morphine was significantly lower than in the control group. The intraoperative music group reported less pain after 1 h in the post anaesthesia care unit. There was no difference in IgA, blood glucose, BP, HR and oxygen saturation between the groups. Conclusion: This study suggests that intraoperative music may decrease postoperative pain, and that postoperative music therapy may reduce anxiety, pain and morphine consumption."

        "Abstract":"Background: Although music interventions on postoperative pain (POP) have positive effects, limited research has focused on systematic reviews and meta-analyses of its efficacy for orthopedic patients. This systematic review aimed to examine the effects of music therapy on pain after orthopedic surgery. Method: The Cochrane Library, PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Nursing Reference Center (NRC), Airiti Library, and National Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations in Taiwan were searched up to August 2019. The risk of bias from the Cochrane Handbook for Randomized Controlled Trials of Interventions was used. A standard mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) was applied as a summary effect on postoperative pain and anxiety using RevMan version 5.3. A meta-analysis was also carried out using subgroup analysis. Results: Nine randomized controlled trials were selected. (1) Music can relieve pain significantly for both music medicine (MM; SMD = -0.41, 95% CI [-0.75, -0.07], P = 0.02) and music therapy (MT; SMD = -0.31, 95% CI [-0.57, 0.04], P = 0.02). (2) Music chosen by the subjects showed significant differences for both MM (P = 0.002) and MT (P = 0.02). (3) Anxiety improved significantly among patients using MT (SMD = 0.44, 95% CI [-0.75, -0.13], P = 0.005). However, the results for the physiologic parameters, opioid requirement, and length of stay showed subtle distinctions. Conclusion: Music can significantly relieve POP, specifically music chosen by the participants."

Material and methods: The study is a simple blind, controlled, parallel groups, prospective randomized clinical trial. Patients were allocated by means of randomized controlled sampling. The study was performed in the surgery room of Getafe University Hospital in Madrid. The study was carried out in 40 patients, 20 randomized to the experimental group and 20 randomized to the control group, with an age range from 27 to 70 years. The control group was given intraoperative routine attention, and the experimental group was given an MT passive intervention that consisted of audition of musical fragments during varicose veins surgery. These pieces previously showed relaxing actions on the cardiovascular system. The anxiety levels were measured by means of pre- and postsurgical questionnaires by a blinded investigator for the study arm to which the patients had been randomized. Heart rate and systolic and diastolic blood pressures were determined during the intervention, and adrenaline and noradrenaline plasma levels were determined before and after the surgical procedure. Results: The majority of the patients in the MT group (95%) and standard care group (90%) completed the study. There were no statistical differences between the control and experimental groups in heart rate gradient or systolic and diastolic blood pressures measured after the intervention. The anxiety state and the stress feeling scale score after surgery were significantly inferior in the MT group (94.7% vs 57.9% decrease in anxiety levels, P < .05, and stress score of 1.31 vs 2.36, P < .05, respectively). The adverse events ratio was low and occurred with similar frequency in both groups. Conclusions: The MT intervention was easily implemented in the context of nursing care received during varicose vein surgery and was positively accepted and valued by the majority of the patients. MT is a safe procedure that is proved to reduce anxiety and stress in the study patients."

        "Abstract":"Background: A cardiac catheterization laboratory can be a frightening environment and music can be a supportive source of environmental sound that stimulates and maintains relaxation. However, the results of studies are conflicting in this regard. Objectives: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of music therapy on patients' anxiety and hemodynamic parameters during percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. Patients and methods: This was a randomized controlled trial, conducted in the Catheterization Laboratory Unit of Baqiyatallah Hospital, in Tehran, Iran. A sample of 64 patients, who were planned to undergo coronary angioplasty, was recruited. Patients were randomly allocated to either the control or the experimental groups. In the experimental group, patients received a 20 to 40-minute music therapy intervention, consisting of light instrumental music albums by Johann Sebastian Bach and Mariko Makino. Patients in the control group received the routine care of the study setting, which consisted of no music therapy intervention. Study data were collected by a demographic questionnaire, the Spielberger's State Anxiety Inventory, and a data sheet for documenting hemodynamic parameters. Chi-square, independent-samples t tests, paired-samples t-test and repeated measures analysis of variance were used to analyze the data. Results: Before the intervention, the study groups did not differ significantly in terms of anxiety level and hemodynamic parameters. Moreover, the differences between the two groups, regarding hemodynamic parameters, were not significant after the intervention (P > 0.05). However, the level of post-intervention anxiety in the experimental group was significantly lower than the control group (32.06 ± 8.57 and 38.97 ± 12.77, respectively; P = 0.014). Compared with the baseline readings, the level of anxiety in the control group did not change significantly after the study (41.91 ± 9.88 vs. 38.97 ± 12.77; P = 0.101); however, in the experimental group, the level of post-intervention anxiety was significantly lower than the pretest readings (32.06 ± 8.57 vs. 41.16 ± 10.6; P = 0.001). Conclusions: Music therapy is a safe, simple, inexpensive, and non-invasive nursing intervention, which can significantly alleviate patients' anxiety during coronary angioplasty."

        "Abstract":"Objective: To investigate the effect of music therapy on chronic pain, quality of life, and quality of sleep in adolescent patients after transthoracic occlusion of ventricular septal defects. Methods: Patients were divided into 2 groups based on whether they received music therapy: a control group and a music group. The music group received 30 minutes of music therapy every day for 6 months after surgery. Patients in the control group received standard treatment and had 30 minutes of quiet time every day for 6 months after surgery. The short-form McGill pain questionnaire (SF-MPQ), the SF-36 scale and the Karolinska Sleep Questionnaire (KSQ) was used as the evaluation tool for chronic pain, quality of life, and quality of sleep, respectively. Results: In terms of the degree of postoperative chronic pain, the Pain Rating Index (PRI) emotion item score in the SF-MPQ evaluation of the music group was significantly lower than that of the control group (1.6 ± 1.1 versus 2.2 ± 0.9). The role emotional (RE) scores of the SF-36 in the music group were significantly higher than that in the control group (77.35 ± 18.55 versus 42.66 ± 22.63). KSQ scores were significantly higher in the music group than in the control group for sleep status (4.1 ± 1.0 versus 3.3 ± 0.9), falling asleep (3.9 ± 1.1 versus 3.1 ± 1.0), and not feeling refreshed by sleep (3.6 ± 1.3 versus 2.7 ± 0.9) (P < .05). Conclusion: This study preliminarily showed that music therapy could effectively reduce patients' chronic pain and improve quality of life and sleep after surgery. These results suggest that music therapy may be an essential therapy worth considering in managing patients' postoperative recovery after cardiovascular surgery."

Methods: A retrospective study of 99 patients after coronary artery bypass from January 2017 to January 2019 was conducted in a cardiac center in China. According to the different interventions, all the participants were divided into 3 groups: group A: music therapy; group B: rest without music therapy; and group C: conventional treatment. The Numerical Rating Scale (NRS), Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) and Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) were used to measure the patient's pain, anxiety and depression before and after 30 min of the intervention. Results: There were no significant differences in the NRS, SDS and SAS scores between the three groups of patients before the intervention. After 30 min of music therapy, the NRS, SDS and SAS scores of patients in group A were significantly lower than those before music therapy, and the differences were statistically significant. However, before and after the intervention in groups B and C, the NRS, SDS and SAS scores were not statistically significant. By comparison among the three groups after 30 min of intervention, the NRS, SDS and SAS scores in patients in group A were significantly lower than those in groups B and C, and the differences were statistically significant. The scores were not significantly different between groups B and C. Conclusion: Music therapy can effectively alleviate the pain, anxiety and depression of patients after coronary artery bypass grafting."

Methods: A total of 222 patients undergoing mechanical MVR were divided into two groups: the music group and the control group. The patients in the music group received 30 minutes of music therapy every day, whereas the patients in the control group had 30 minutes of quiet time. The visual analogue scale (VAS) was used to evaluate the degree of pain, and the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) was used to evaluate the degree of early postoperative anxiety. We also recorded the sleep duration of the patients and used the Verran and Snyder-Halpern (VSH) Sleep Scale to evaluate the sleep quality of the patients. Results: The VAS scores in the music group were significantly lower than those in the control group, and early postoperative anxiety in the music group was also significantly improved compared with that in the control group. The sleep duration in the music group was significantly greater than that in the control group. In the evaluation of sleep quality using the VSH Sleep Scale, the scores for sleep interruption, sleep length, sleep depth, degree of rest, and subjective sleep quality in the music group were significantly lower than those in the control group. Conclusions: Music therapy can be an effective intervention to reduce early postoperative pain, relieve early postoperative anxiety, prolong sleep time, and improve the sleep quality of patients after mechanical MVR."

Design: A repeated-measures randomized controlled trial was used. Setting: The study took place in three intensive care units in Hong Kong. Patients: Sixty-six patients undergoing application of a C-clamp after PCI were recruited. Outcome measures: Physiologic parameters were blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. Psychologic parameters were measured using the University of California at Los Angeles universal pain score. Intervention: Patients were randomized to receive 45 minutes of music therapy or 45 minutes of an uninterrupted rest period. Three types of music were used, including Chinese classical music, religious music, and Western classical music that had slow beats and was relaxing. The data were collected from September 2004 to December 2005. Results: In the experimental group there were statistically significant reductions in heart rate (P < .001), respiratory rate (P < .001), and oxygen saturation (P < .001), and a lower pain score (P < .001) than in the control group. Conclusion: Music is a simple, safe, and effective method of reducing potentially harmful physiologic and psychologic responses arising from pain in patients post-PCI undergoing a C-clamp procedure."

Therefore, improving the cardiovascular indices and anxiety is essential. Objectives: This study aimed to investigate the effect of music therapy on anxiety and cardiovascular indices in patients undergoing CABG. Patients and methods: In this randomized controlled trial, 60 patients hospitalized in the cardiovascular surgical intensive care unit of Shahid Beheshti Hospital in Qom city, Iran, in 2013 were selected using a consecutive sampling method and randomly allocated into the experimental and control groups. In the experimental group, patients received 30 minutes of light music, whereas in the control group, patients had 30 minutes of rest in bed. The cardiovascular indices and anxiety were measured immediately before, immediately after and half an hour after the study. Data were analyzed using the chi-square test and repeated measures analysis of variance. Results: Compared to the immediately before intervention, the mean anxiety scores immediately after and 30 minutes after the intervention were significantly lower in the experimental group (P < 0.037) while it did not significantly change in the control group. However, there were no significant differences regarding the cardiovascular indices in the three consecutive measurements (P > 0.05). Conclusions: Music therapy is effective in decreasing anxiety among patients undergoing CABG. However, the intervention was not effective on cardiovascular indices. Music can effectively be used as a non-pharmacological method to manage anxiety after CABG."

The secondary endpoints were the myocardial infarction dimensional assessment scale, self-rating sleep status, 6-minute walk test, and left ventricular ejection fraction. Results: The study included 150 AMI patients (n = 50\/group). Hospital anxiety and depression scale showed significant time effects for both anxiety and depression (both P < .05), a treatment effect for depression (P = .02), and an interaction effect for anxiety (P = .02). A time effect was also observed for diet, sleep disorders, 6-minute walk test, and left ventricular ejection fraction (all P < .001). A difference among groups was observed for emotional reaction (P = .001). Interactions effects were observed for diet (P = .01) and sleep disorders (P = .03). Conclusion: Phase I cardiac rehabilitation combined with 5-phase music could alleviate anxiety and depression and improve sleep quality."

        "Abstract":"Purpose: Radiation therapy (RT) is associated with high stress levels. The role of music therapy (MT) for patients receiving RT is not well described. This study evaluates the impact of MT on anxiety and distress during simulation in patients with newly diagnosed head and neck or breast cancer. Methods and materials: This institutional review board-approved randomized trial of MT versus no MT at the time of simulation included the pre-State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-S Anxiety) questionnaire and Symptom Distress Thermometer (SDT). Patients randomized to MT received a consultation with a music therapist, during which music of the patients' choice to be played during simulation was selected. The no-MT patients did not receive the MT consultation, nor did they hear prerecorded music during simulation. Subsequent to the simulation, all patients repeated the STAI-S Anxiety questionnaire and the SDT. Results: Of the 78 patients enrolled (39 in MT group and 39 in no-MT group), 38 had breast cancer and 40 had head and neck cancer. The male-female ratio was 27:51. The overall mean pre- and post-simulation STAI-S scores were 38.7 (range, 20-60) and 35.2 (range, 20-72), respectively. The overall mean pre- and post-simulation SDT scores were 3.2 (range, 0-10) and 2.5 (range, 0-10), respectively. The MT group had mean pre- and post-simulation STAI-S scores of 39.1 and 31.0, respectively (P<.0001), and the mean SDT scores before and after simulation were 3.2 and 1.7, respectively (P<.0001). The no-MT group's mean pre- and post-simulation STAI-S scores were 38.3 and 39.5, respectively (P=.46), and the mean SDT scores were 3 and 3.2, respectively (P=.51). Conclusions: MT significantly lowered patient anxiety and distress during the simulation procedure on the basis of the STAI-S questionnaire and SDT. Incorporating culturally centered individualized MT may be an effective intervention to reduce stressors. Continued research defining the role of MT intervention in improving the patient experience by reducing anxiety is warranted."

The music therapy method involved children creating a music CD using interactive computer-based music software, which was \"remixed\" by the music therapist-researcher to extend the musical material. Eleven pediatric radiation therapy outpatients aged 6 to 13 years were randomly assigned to either an experimental group, in which they could create a music CD prior to their initial treatment to listen to during radiation therapy, or to a standard care group. Quantitative and qualitative analyses generated multiple perceptions from the pediatric patients, parents, radiation therapy staff, and music therapist-researcher. Ratings of distress during initial radiation therapy treatment were low for all children. The comparison between the two groups found that 67% of the children in the standard care group used social withdrawal as a coping strategy, compared to 0% of the children in the music therapy group; this trend approached significance (p = 0.076). MTCD creation was a fun, engaging, and developmentally appropriate intervention for pediatric patients, which offered a positive experience and aided their use of effective coping strategies to meet the demands of their initial radiation therapy treatment."

In this study, the effects of music listening on anxiety and stress in patients undergoing radiotherapy are investigated. Sixty patients with breast cancer who were candidates for postoperative curative radiotherapy were recruited and randomly assigned to three groups: Melomics-Health (MH) group (music listening algorithmically created, n = 20); individualized music listening (IML) group (playlist of preferred music, n = 20); no music group (n = 20). Music listening was administered for 15 min immediately before simulation and during the first five radiotherapy sessions. The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and the Psychological Distress Inventory (PDI) were administered before\/after treatment. Cochran's Q test and McNemar test for paired proportions were performed to evaluate if the proportion of subjects having an outcome score below the critical value by treatment and over time was different, and if there was a change in that proportion. The MH group improved in STAI and PDI. The IML group worsened in STAI at T1 and improved STAI-Trait at T2. The IML group worsened in PDI at T2. The No music group generally improved in STAI and PDI. Clinical and music listening-related implications are discussed defining possible research perspectives in this field."

        "Abstract":"Aims: To determine the effect of music therapy and verbal relaxation on state anxiety and anxiety-induced physiological manifestations among patients with cancer before and after chemotherapy. Background: Cancer and its treatment provoke a series of changes in the emotional sphere of the patient's anxiety. Music therapy and verbal relaxation had reported the anxiety reduction effect on patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy. Few studies have been undertaken comparing music therapy and verbal relaxation in differentiating high-normal state anxiety subsample. Design: A randomised controlled trial and permuted block design were used. Outpatient chemotherapy clinic operated by a University medical centre in southern Taiwan. Methods: Ninety-eight patients were randomised into three groups: the music therapy group received one-hour single music session; the verbal relaxation group received 30 minutes of guided relaxation; the control group received usual care. Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Instrument, Emotional Visual Analog Scale, three biobehavioural indicators: skin temperature, heart rate and consciousness level were measured during and after chemotherapy. Result: Music therapy had a greater positive effect on postchemotherapy anxiety than verbal relaxation and control groups and a significantly increase in skin temperature. Patients with high state anxiety receiving music therapy had a greater drop in postchemotherapy anxiety than did the normal state anxiety subsample. Conclusions: Both music and verbal relaxation therapy are effective in reducing chemotherapy-induced anxiety. Thirty minutes of intervention initiates anxiety reduction. Patients with high state anxiety receiving chemotherapy obtain the most benefit from music or verbal relaxation. Relevance to clinical practice: Prior to chemotherapy, patients with high state anxiety must be sorted from all patients as they are more responsive to interventions. Oncology nurses can offer music and verbal relaxation as adjuvant interventions to reduce chemotherapy-induced anxiety and enhance the quality of care."

This randomized clinical trial examined the effectiveness of a music listening intervention, delivered by a board-certified music therapist, in patients undergoing curative radiation therapy (RT). Emotional distress (anxiety, depression, and treatment-related distress) and symptoms (fatigue and pain) were measured at baseline, mid-treatment, and end of treatment in 63 patients undergoing RT. Although patients who listened to self-selected music reported lower anxiety and treatment-related distress, there was a decline in these outcomes for patients in both groups over the course of RT. Depression, fatigue, and pain were not appreciably affected by music therapy. Within the music group, there was a significant correlation between number of times music was used\/week and the change in treatment-related distress, suggesting that higher doses of music produced greater declines in distress. While these findings provided some support for the use of music in reducing distress during RT, further research demonstrating clear differences between intervention and control conditions is needed. Physical symptoms were not affected by the use of music over the course of RT."

        "Abstract":"Background and objectives: Music medicine is a non-pharmacologic intervention that is virtually harm-free, relatively inexpensive and has been shown to significantly decrease preoperative anxiety. In this study we aim to compare the use of music to midazolam as a preoperative anxiolytic prior to the administration of an ultrasound-guided single-injection peripheral nerve block. Methods: In this randomized controlled study we compared the anxiolytic effects of intravenous midazolam (1-2 mg) with noise-canceling headphone-delivered music medicine. All patients received a preoperative ultrasound-guided single-injection peripheral nerve block indicated for a primary regional anesthetic or postoperative analgesia. Results: The change in the State Trait Anxiety Inventory-6 (STAI-6) anxiety scores from after to before the procedure were similar in both groups (music group -1.6 (SD 10.7); midazolam group -4.2 (SD 11); p=0.14; mean difference between groups -2.5 (95% CI -5.9 to 0.9), p=0.1). Patient satisfaction scores with their procedure experience were higher in the midazolam group (p=0.01); however, there were no differences in physician satisfaction scores of their procedure experience between groups (p=0.07). Both patient and physician perceptions on difficulties in communication were higher in the music group than in the midazolam group (p=0.005 and p=0.0007, respectively). Conclusions: Music medicine may be offered as an alternative to midazolam administration prior to peripheral regional anesthesia. However, further studies are warranted to evaluate whether or not the type of music, as well as how it is delivered, offers advantages over midazolam that outweigh the increase in communication barriers.

Methods: Eighty patients who were scheduled for a surgery that would use regional anesthesia were allocated to either the music therapy group listened to music using headphones for the entire surgery or no-treatment control group. Outcome measures were blood pressure (BP) and the BIS index. Results: Anxiety was significantly differed between the two groups (t=11.27, p=<.001). The BIS index was significantly lower in the experimental group than the control group from 15min to the end of the operation (F=7.25, p<.001). Vital signs marginally differed between the two groups. Conclusion: Music therapy during surgery maybe an effective nursing intervention that relieves anxiety and increases sedation in patients undergoing surgery with regional anesthesia."

Methods: This study was a nonequivalent control group nonsynchronized design. Pregnant women (n =232) were assigned to experimental (n= 117) and control (n =116) groups respectively. The data were collected from August 2 to 27, 2010. The experimental group received general prenatal care and single 30-minute session of music therapy, while the control group received only general prenatal care. Anxiety, stress, and maternal-fetal attachment was assessed using three self-report measures by State scale of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (1976), Pregnant women's stress scale of Ahn (1984) and Cranley's (1981) maternal-fetal attachment scale. Results: The music therapy group showed statistically significant decrease in anxiety compared to control group but no significant difference was identified in stress and maternal-fetal attachment. Conclusions: The finding provides evidence for use of nursing intervention in prenatal care unit to reduce pregnant women's anxiety. Further research is necessary to test the benefits of music therapy with different frequency and duration."

Hence, the use of music to ease the anxiety of patients has been examined in various studies, but the results have been inconclusive. The aim of this review is to synthesize the findings of previous studies on the effects of music therapy on the physiological outcomes of patients undergoing bronchoscopy. An electronic database search was performed to identify the literature. Random-effects model was used to combine the results, and meta-regression was used to explore the heterogeneity. Seven studies with 829 subjects were included. Results showed that the combined mean differences (95% confidence interval) for systolic and diastolic blood pressure were -11.99 (-15.82, -6.57) and -4.84 (-7.78, -1.90) mm Hg, respectively, whereas that for heart rate was -10.57 (-16.63, -4.51) beats per minute. In conclusion, listening to music reduced blood pressure and heart rate among patients undergoing bronchoscopy."

In this meta-analysis we focused on the effects of music therapy on patients undergoing gastrointestinal endoscopic procedures. Materials and methods: A literature search using the PubMed and Cochrane Library databases and a manual search led to the inclusion of six randomized controlled trials that examined the effects of music therapy on patients undergoing gastrointestinal endoscopic procedures. After data extraction, four separate meta-analyses were performed: in the three studies that did not use pharmacotherapy (group A), anxiety levels were used as a measure of efficacy; in the three studies in which pharmacotherapy was used (group B), sedation and analgesia requirements and procedure duration times were analyzed. Results: A total of 641 patients were included in the analysis. In group A, patients receiving music therapy exhibited lower anxiety levels (8.6% reduction, P = 0.004), compared with controls. In group B, patients receiving music therapy exhibited statistically significant reductions in analgesia requirements (29.7% reduction, P = 0.001) and procedure times (21% reduction, P = 0.002), and a reduction in sedation requirements that approached significance (15% reduction, P = 0.055), in comparison with controls. Conclusions: Music therapy is an effective tool for stress relief and analgesia in patients undergoing gastrointestinal endoscopic procedures."

        "Abstract":"Objectives: Many patients experience anxiety during MRI examinations. However, little attention has been focused on decreasing patient anxiety and minimizing on-site cancellations. Here, we aimed to investigate the effects of aromatherapy and music therapy on alleviating anxiety during MRI examinations. Methods: This single-center, double-blinded, randomized control trial was conducted between November 1, 2021, and January 10, 2022. Patients undergoing MRI examinations were assigned randomly into either the aromatherapy group (AG), music therapy group (MG), aromatherapy plus music therapy group (AMTG), or routine care group (RG) at a ratio of 1:1:1:1. Aromatherapy was conducted through inhalation of lavender oil. Music therapy was performed using Pachelbel's Canon in D major. The primary outcome was the change in anxiety before and after the MRI scan, assessed using both the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory form 1 (STAI-1) and Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS). The second outcome was the participant's comfort, measured using Kolcaba's General Comfort Questionnaire (GCQ). Results: A total of 200 participants (mean age: 48.3 ± 14.9 years; 126 [63.0%] females) were enrolled, with 50 per group. The mean anxiety scores of the AMTG showed greater reduction compared with the AG, MG, and RG (ΔSTAI-1: 6.5 vs 2.6 vs 2.7 vs 1.9, p < 0.001; ΔSAS: 4.0 vs 1.4 vs 1.7 vs 0.6, p < 0.001). The mean GCQ score of the AMTG was higher compared with the AG, MG, and RG (98.0 vs 92.6 vs 91.2 vs 89.2, respectively, p < 0.001). Conclusion: Aromatherapy combined with music therapy is effective for reducing patients' anxiety and improving their comfort level during MRI scans. Key points: • In this randomized control trial of 200 participants undergoing MRI scans, aromatherapy plus music therapy is effective in reducing STAI-1 and SAS, as well as improving GCQ scores. • Although there was a significant difference between the aromatherapy plus music therapy and the single-intervention modalities, no significant differences were observed between the aromatherapy and music therapy themselves for state anxiety and comfort score. • Aromatherapy plus music therapy is a safe, non-invasive, nonpharmacological, and inexpensive patient-centered intervention for reducing anxiety and improving comfort in adults undergoing MRI examinations."

Design and setting: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials. Interventions: Five databases were systematically searched. The included studies reported randomized controlled trials comparing the effects of music therapy and non-music therapy on pain, anxiety, and physiologic parameters in patients undergoing prostate biopsy. The random-effects meta-analyses were performed for data synthesis. Main outcome measures: The primary outcome was pain; secondary outcomes included anxiety and physiologic parameters. Results: We analyzed seven eligible studies involving 662 males undergoing prostate biopsy. We synthesized the mean difference between music and control groups in different outcomes. Compared with control groups, music therapy reduced pain (visual analog scale score, mean difference [95% CI]: -0.92 [-1.68 to -0.17], P = 0.017, low quality) and anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory equivalent scale score, mean difference [95% CI]: -4.37 [-7.72 to -1.03], P = 0.010, low quality) after the prostate biopsy. In terms of the physiological parameters, music therapy only slightly reduced heart rate, but not blood pressure and respiratory rate after the prostate biopsy. Conclusions: Low quality of evidence showed that music therapy during prostate biopsy might reduce pain and anxiety. However, a good standard of music intervention was lacking. Cost-effective analyses are warranted to better delineate the value of music therapies for prostate biopsy."

In the search for alternative methods, some studies have analysed the effect music can have on patients during the procedure when used as a complement to sedation. We present a prospective, randomized study in which we assess the anxiolytic action music has when it is administered during a single colonoscopy. Patients and methods: We included 118 patients who were scheduled for ambulatory colonoscopies. They were randomly assigned to the control group (n = 55) and the experimental group (n = 63). We determined their levels of anxiety using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory Test (STAI) form, which they filled in before and after the examination. Patients listened to music through personal headphones. Results: The score on the STAI form before the examination was 25.25 +\/- 10.49 and 28.16 +\/- 11.43 in the control and experimental groups, respectively (P > 0.05). The decrease of the score on the STAI scale after the colonoscopy in the control and experimental groups was 6.27 (95% confidence interval, 3.26-9.28) and 11.35 (95% confidence interval, 8.64-14.05), respectively (P < 0.01). Conclusions: Listening to music during ambulatory colonoscopies decreases the level of anxiety that is inherent to the process without other anxiolytic methods."

        "Abstract":"Aim: This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of music therapy for reducing the anxiety and pain of patients who underwent a biopsy. Background: Music can affect human anxiety and pain by triggering a neuroendocrine effect. Clinical study results indicated that music can influence the anxiety and pain caused by invasive procedures. There is no effective solution for anxiety and pain arising from a biopsy. Although researchers in this field have different views, music still holds promise in reducing the anxiety and pain in patients undergoing the biopsy. Design: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials. Data sources: Systematic searches were conducted in PubMed, Embase, Medline and Cochrane databases for studies reported in the English language. The review period covered 2000 - December 2016. The outcome measure of interest was anxiety and pain. Methods: This review followed Cochrane methods. Studies were selected according to the PICOS framework. The methodological quality of studies was assessed with the Cochrane risk of bias tool. A systematic review of effectiveness was conducted by using GRADE approach. Results: Nine randomized controlled trials with a total of 326 participants in the music intervention group and 323 controls met the inclusion criteria. Music had a tendency towards decreasing systolic blood pressure before the biopsy, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory scores after the biopsy, diastolic blood pressure after the biopsy and heart rate after the biopsy. Similarly, music also tended to be more effective for controlling pain after the biopsy. There was moderate quality evidence for the outcome: State-Trait Anxiety Inventory scores after the biopsy; and low- or very low-quality evidence for other outcomes. Conclusion: Music can be used for patients before and during the biopsy procedure. This approach may be performed by nurses to promote the recovery of patients after the biopsy."

        "Abstract":"Background: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have a high prevalence of emotional disturbances which worsen the symptoms of the disease. As a therapeutic alternative that is part of a comprehensive care alongside medication, the Bonny Method of Guided Imagery and Music (BMGIM) music-assisted therapy has achieved promising emotional improvements in patients with chronic diseases. The objective of the study was to determine the impact of a treatment based on a BMGIM group adaptation on patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and their emotional state, therefore analyzing state of mind, quality of life, anxiety, depression, immunocompetence as a marker of well-being, and levels of acute and chronic stress. Methods: Longitudinal, prospective, quantitative, and experimental study including 43 patients with IBD divided into an intervention group (22 patients), who received eight sessions over eight weeks, and a control group (21 patients). A saliva sample was taken from each patient before and after each session in order to determine cortisol and IgA levels. Similarly, a hair sample was taken before the first and after the last session to determine the cumulative cortisol level. All molecules were quantified using the ELISA immunoassay technique. In addition, patients completed several emotional state questionnaires: HADS, MOOD, and CCVEII. Results: An improvement was observed in the following states of mind: sadness, fear, anger, and depression. No significant effect was observed in state of mind in terms of happiness or anxiety, in the levels of cortisol in hair, and in patients' perceived quality of life. A reduction in cortisol was observed in saliva, although this did not significantly affect the IgA titer. Conclusions: BMGIM seems to improve the emotional state of patients with IBD."

        "Abstract":"Background: This study aims to investigate the influence of traditional Chinese music on the physical and psychological functions of hospitalized patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS). Subjects and methods: A total of 120 patients with AS admitted to the People's Hospital of Anhui Province between March 2018 and March 2019 were randomly divided into experiment and control groups. The experiment group was a traditional music group composed of 56 patients, namely, 50 males and 6 females. The control group was further divided into a painting group and a routine treatment group with a total of 64 patients, namely, 48 males and 16 females. The physical and psychological functions of each group of patients before and after the intervention were assessed in terms of physical and psychological function dimensions obtained before and after the intervention. Results: After 8 weeks of treatment, the score in terms of physical functions is the highest in the music group (P<0.05), and the difference in eating functions is statistically significant (P<0.001). This finding suggests that the music group is better than the painting group and the routine treatment group (P<0.05). In terms of the score in sexual functions, the following trend is observed: music group>painting group>routine treatment group. The difference in their psychological functions is statistically significant (P<0.001). In terms of the score in psychological functions, the following trend is obtained: music group>painting group>routine treatment group. The three groups significantly differ in their scores in mental tension, negative emotion, positive emotion, cognitive functions, and self-esteem. All of these dimensions show the following pattern: music group>painting group>routine treatment group. Cross-group comparisons between the three groups are also statistically significant (P<0.05). Conclusions: Traditional Chinese music therapy and painting therapy can promote the recovery of patients' physical and psychological functions. Traditional Chinese music intervention therapy is better than painting therapy and routine hospitalization in promoting the recovery of physical and psychological functions of hospitalized patients."

        "Abstract":"The effects of patterned sensory enhancement (PSE) music on muscle power and movement control in children with spastic diplegia (SD) during loaded sit-to-stand (LSTS) were investigated. Twenty-three children with SD aged 5 to 12 years were recruited. Individualized PSE was composed by a music therapist based on each subject's sit-to-stand (STS) movement with 50% 1-repetition maximum load. Each subject performed LSTS continuously for eight repetitions under randomly assigned music or no-music (Control) conditions while the kinematic and kinetic data were measured simultaneously. For the music condition, PSE music was played only during the first five repetitions (PSE condition), and the following three repetitions were referred to as the Continuation condition. Paired t- or Wilcoxon signed rank tests were used to compare the variables between the PSE and Control conditions, and between the Continuation and Control conditions. Compared to the Control condition, greater peak knee extensor power (P=0.009), greater total extensor power (P=0.015), and better center-of-mass smoothness (P=0.01), but less movement time (P=0.003) were found in the PSE condition. Significant effects of the PSE music on the above variables were also found for Continuation condition. The current results showed that individualized PSE music helped improve the performance of LSTS in children with SD. The associated biomechanical features also continued to exist in subsequent movement cycles after the music had ceased. These findings suggest that therapy using LSTS combined with PSE music may be beneficial for rehabilitating children with SD."

Communication and relationship during AMT treatment were also evaluated. Thirty patients were assigned randomly to experimental [AMT plus standard of care (SC)] or control (SC) groups. AMT consisted of 12 sessions (three times a week), whereas the SC treatment was based on physical and speech rehabilitation sessions, occupational therapy, and psychological support. ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, McGill Quality of Life Questionnaire, and Music Therapy Rating Scale were administered to assess functional, psychological, and music therapy outcomes. The AMT group improved significantly in McGill Quality of Life Questionnaire global scores (P=0.035) and showed a positive trend in nonverbal and sonorous-music relationship during the treatment. Further studies involving larger samples in a longer AMT intervention are needed to confirm the effectiveness of this approach in ALS."

        "Abstract":"Respiratory failure, malnutrition, aspiration pneumonia, and dehydration are the precursors to mortality in ALS. Loss of natural communication is considered one of the worst aspects of ALS. This first study to test the feasibility of a music therapy protocol for bulbar and respiratory rehabilitation in ALS employs a mixed-methods case study series design with repeated measures. Newly diagnosed patients meeting the inclusion criteria were invited to participate, until the desired sample size (n = 8) was achieved. The protocol was delivered to participants in their homes twice weekly for six weeks. Individualised exercise sets for independent practice were provided. Feasibility data (recruitment, retention, adherence, tolerability, self-motivation and personal impressions) were collected. Bulbar and respiratory changes were objectively measured. Results. A high recruitment rate (100%), a high retention rate (87.5%) and high mean adherence to treatment (95.4%) provide evidence for the feasibility of the study protocol. The treatment was well tolerated. Mean adherence to the suggested independent exercise routine was 53%. The outcome measurements to evaluate the therapy-induced change in bulbar and respiratory functions were defined. Findings suggest that the protocol is safe to use in early- and mid-stage ALS and that music therapy was beneficial for the participants' bulbar and respiratory functions. Mean trends suggesting that these functions were sustained or improved during the treatment period were observed for most outcome parameters: Maximal Inspiratory Pressure, Maximal Expiratory Pressure, Peak Expiratory Flow, the Center for Neurologic Study-Bulbar Function Scale speech and swallowing subscales, Maximum Phonation Time, Maximum Repetition Rate-Alternating, Maximum Repetition Rate-Sequential, Jitter, Shimmer, NHR, Speaking rate, Speech-pause ratio, Pause frequency, hypernasality level, Time-to-Laryngeal Vestibule Closure, Maximum Pharyngeal Constriction Area, Peak Position of the Hyoid Bone, Total Pharyngeal Residue C24area. Conclusion. The suggested design and protocol are feasible for a larger study, with some modifications, including aerodynamic measure of nasalance, abbreviated voice sampling and psychological screening."

        "Abstract":"Routine chest physiotherapy (CPT) is an important component of prophylactic therapy in children with cystic fibrosis (CF) and requires a significant commitment of time and energy. It is important, therefore, to establish CPT as a positive experience. In this study, we evaluated the effect of recorded music as an adjunct to CPT. Specifically, we compared the use of newly composed music, familiar music, and the family's usual routine on children's and parents' enjoyment of CPT and the parents' perception of time taken to complete CPT. Enjoyment and perception of time were evaluated via questionnaires designed specifically for this study. Participants were caregivers of one or more children with CF who were aged between 4(1\/2) months and 24 months at the commencement of the clinical trial and required CPT on a daily basis. Participants were randomly allocated into control and treatment groups. Control group participants experienced two conditions consecutively: no audiotape (NT; control) and familiar music tape (FT; placebo control). Treatment group participants were given the treatment music tape (TT), which was composed and compiled by a music therapist. After baseline assessment, evaluation occurred at two 6-weekly intervals. Children's enjoyment increased significantly after use of the TT (+1. 25 units) compared to NT (-0.5 units; P = 0.03), as did parents' enjoyment (+1.0 vs. 0.0 units, P = 0.02). Children's enjoyment did not change significantly after use of the FT (+0.75 units) compared to NT (n.s.). Likewise, parents' enjoyment did not change significantly after use of the FT (+1.0 units, n.s.). There was no change in perception of time after use of the TT (-4.5 vs. +0.2 min, n.s.) or the FT (+3.3 min, n.s.). These results indicate that children's and parents' enjoyment of CPT significantly increased after the use of specifically composed and recorded music as an adjunct. We therefore recommend that recorded music, such as that provided in this study, be given to parents to use as an adjunct to CPT when their young children are diagnosed with CF, in order to assist the establishment of a positive routine."

        "Abstract":"Airway clearance therapy (ACT) is considered an important approach to improve airway clearance in children with cystic fibrosis (CF). Daily ACT administration requires substantial commitments of time and energy that complicate ACT and reduce its benefits. It is crucial to establish ACT as a positive routine. Music therapy (MT) is an aspect of integrative strategies to ameliorate the psycho-emotional consequences of chronic diseases, and a MT intervention could help children with CF between the ages of 2 and 17 develop a positive response. The aim of this randomized controlled trial was to evaluate the effects of specifically composed and recorded instrumental music as an adjunct to ACT. We compared the use of specifically composed music (Treated Group, TG), music that the patient liked (Placebo Group, PG), and no music (Control Group, CG) during the usual ACT routine in children with CF aged from 2 to 17. The primary outcomes, i.e., enjoyment and perception of time, were evaluated via validated questionnaires. The secondary outcome, i.e., efficiency, was evaluated in terms of avoided healthcare resources. Enjoyment increased after the use of the specifically composed music (children +0.9 units\/parents +1.7 units; p<0.05) compared to enjoyment with no music (0 units) and familiar music (+0.5 units). Perception of time was 11.1 min (±3.9) less than the actual time in the TG (p<0.05), 3.9 min (±4.2) more than the actual time in the PG and unchanged in the CG. The potential cost saving related to respiratory exacerbations was €6,704.87, while the cost increased to €33,524.35 in the CG and to €13,409.74 in the PG. In conclusion, the specifically composed, played and compiled instrumental recorded music is an effective adjunct to ACT to establish a positive response and is an efficient option in terms of avoided costs.

Methods: We searched Cochrane Library, PubMed, Embase, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases from inception to January 24, 2021. The language of publication was limited to English. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that used art therapy to improve mental disorders in diabetic patients were involved. After selection of eligible studies, data were extracted, including the first author's full-name, year of publication, the first author's country of residence, number of intervention and control groups, the mean age of participants, method of intervention, duration of follow-up, and outcome measures. Assessment of quality of the included studies and data extraction were independently carried out by two researchers. RevMan 5.3 software was used to perform statistical analysis. Results: A total of 396 samples from five studies were included, and the eligible studies were RCTs with a parallel design. Methods of art therapy included music therapy and painting therapy. The results showed that compared with the control group, art therapy could positively affect the levels of depression [standardized mean difference (SMD), -1.36; 95% confidence interval (CI), (-1.63, -1.09); P < 0.00001] and blood glucose in diabetic patients [mean difference (MD), -0.90; 95% CI, (-1.03, -0.77); P < 0.0001], while it had no influence on the levels of anxiety [SMD, -0.31; 95% CI, (-0.93, 0.31); P = 0.32] and glycated hemoglobin [MD, 0.22; 95% CI, (-0.02, 0.46); P = 0.07]. Conclusion: Art therapy may have significant effects on the levels of depression and blood glucose for diabetic patients."

        "Abstract":"Background: Recent research found evidence supporting music therapy for hospitalized children with chronic diseases. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of music therapy on hospitalized children's vital signs. Methods: In this prospective study, children with chronic gastroenterological and nephrological diseases received active or receptive music therapy two to four times a week until discharge from hospital at the pediatric special care unit (SCU) and pediatric intensive care unit (ICU). Baseline and post-therapy heart rate, oxygen saturation and blood pressure were recorded and analyzed as control values at three points on the same day when the children were alone in their patient room at rest. Results: A total of 83 children, median 3 age of years (range one month to eighteen years) received music therapy. In total, 377 music therapy sessions were treated: 200 receptive therapy (78 ICU, 122 SCU) and 177 with active therapy (0 ICU, 177 SCU). Music therapy interventions showed changes in vital signs during music therapy sessions. After music therapy, heart rates decreased by 18 beats per minute (95% confidence interval (CI), -19.4 to (-16.8)), oxygen saturation increased by 2.3% (95% CI, 2.2 to 2.5), systolic blood pressure decreased by 9.2 (95% CI, -10.6 to -7.7) and diastolic blood pressure decreased by 7.9 (95% CI, -9.6 to -6.3). When music therapy was applied at the SCU (ICU), heart rates significantly reduced by 17.9 (18.9) beats per min, oxygen saturation increased by 2.4% (2.1%) and blood pressure reduced by 9.2 (2.8) mmHg (systolic) and 7.9 (0.3) mmHg (diastolic). Almost all control values were better than directly before the intervention. However, after music therapy intervention, the children showed better values in vital signs compared to being alone in their patient room. Conclusion: Music therapy is an added value for children with kidney and liver\/gastrointestinal diseases during their hospital stay."

Method: Thirty-seven patients with psychotic disorders were randomly assigned to an experimental group and a control group. Both groups received medication and treatment indicated for their disorder. Additionally, the experimental group (n = 21) underwent group music therapy. Results: Significant effects of music therapy are found in patients' self-evaluation of their psychosocial orientation and for negative symptoms. No differences were found in the quality of life. Conclusion: Musical activity diminishes negative symptoms and improves interpersonal contact. These positive effects of music therapy could increase the patient's abilities to adapt to the social environment in the community after discharge from the hospital."

        "Abstract":"Introduction: Patients undergoing endodontic therapy often have severe perioperative and intraoperative anxiety, which may lead to increased perceptions of pain and vital sign instability throughout treatment. The purpose of this study was to test the influences of music, as a nonpharmacologic adjuvant, in terms of significant changes for systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and heart rate (HR) before, during, and after endodontic treatment in a population with different levels of anxiety assessed with the Corah Dental Anxiety Scale. Methods: A total of 100 patients were recruited in the present study; before starting the endodontic treatment, the interviewer administered the Corah Dental Anxiety Scale to the participants to assess the baseline level of anxiety. Patients were randomly divided into 2 groups: the first one listened to the music and the second one did not. Before, during, and after the endodontic procedures, the vital signs (diastolic and systolic blood pressure and heart rate) were recorded. Results were collected and statistically analyzed. Results: Direct contrasts between patients listening or not listening to music showed that all the measured vital signs decreased considering the overall period (during and after the canal therapy) in the group of patients listening to music (P < .05). Conclusions: This study shows the effects of music therapy on vital values and on subjective perception of anxiety during endodontic therapy. Music and medicine always work together; the soothing effects of sounds and musical frequencies make this union an extraordinary tool of synergistic care. Music therapy is a valid nonpharmacologic adjuvant to anxiety perception in endodontic therapies."

        "Abstract":"Objective: To evaluate whether listening to music through binaural headphones contributes to the perception of pain and anxiety in patients undergoing closed nasal bone fracture reductions. Study design: Randomized controlled trial. Subjects and methods: We recruited patients from San Juan de Dios Hospital with displaced nasal fractures who required a reduction and assigned them to a control group or a music group. For both groups, a protocolized closed reduction of the nasal fracture with local anesthesia was performed. The music group heard music through headphones during the pre-, intra-, and postprocedural periods of the intervention. Physiological variables (blood pressure and heart rate) were measured. An anxiety survey (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory) and the visual analog scale for measuring pain were also applied. Results: The music group exhibited significantly lower levels of systolic blood pressure (P = .0001), anxiety (P < .0001), and pain (P = .0004) than the control group. Conclusion: Listening to music through headphones-a safe and low-cost intervention-appears to aid in pain and anxiety management associated with procedures that are usually uncomfortable, such as the reduction of nasal bone fractures with local anesthesia. We believe that this effect is achieved by the modulation of pain and anxiety on an emotional-affective dimension at a central level. Given its safety, feasibility, and low cost, music therapy should be considered a complementary treatment for pain and anxiety management for nasal fracture reduction performed with local anesthesia, as well as for other medical procedures of similar pain levels conducted without general anesthesia."

        "Abstract":"Introduction: Cast room procedures generally cause anxiety in patients. Anxiety complicates the procedure as well as increases the risk of a complication. Listening to music was found to be the safest and most common non-drug treatment method. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of listening to music on adult patients in cast room procedures. This study points out the relation between anxiety and anxiety relevant cardiac arrhythmia. Materials and methods: The study was performed on 199 patients with stable general condition, aged above 18. The patients were divided into two groups. Randomization method used in the study was coin flip. The first group (Group 1) listened to music during cast room procedures whereby the second group (Group 2) did not listen to music. Length of the procedure, complication, blood pressure and heart rate evaluations before and after the procedure, Visual Analogue Scale (VAS scores for pain), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) anxiety score, patient satisfaction, willingness of the patient to repeat the procedure, P wave dispersion (Pd) and corrected QT interval dispersion (QTcd) as electrocardiographic arrhythmia predictors were evaluated. The Clinical Research Ethics Committee approval was obtained for this study. Results: Significant difference was shown between the two groups for the following criteria: VAS scores (p = 0.005), anxiety scores (p = 0.032), processing time (p = 0.027), and QTcd values (p = 0.031). Patient satisfaction (p < 0.001) and willingness to repeat the procedure (p < 0.001) were higher for the group who listened to music. No significant difference in Pd values, blood pressure and heart rate was reported within the groups. Conclusion: Music therapy is a non-invasive, safe, nonpharmacologic, anxiolytic, and analgesic treatment. Music therapy should become standard protocol in cast room procedures. One of the most important achievements of this study was the fact that music decreases anxiety and anxiety-related cardiac arrhythmia. Therefore, conducting further prospective studies including high cardiac risk patients especially with arrhythmia is crucial."

        "Abstract":"Background of the topic revealed that orthopedic surgery is one of the most painful surgeries in which music therapy is found to be effective for reducing pain and anxiety. This study aimed to examine the effect of music therapy on pain, anxiety, and the use of opioids among patients who underwent orthopedic surgery. Methods include a comprehensive search was conducted in PubMed\/MEDLINE, Embase, Ovid, Clinical Key, and Google Scholar for relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-experimental studies published until December 2020 in the English language regarding music therapy in comparison to standard care on pain, anxiety, and opioid use among postoperative orthopedic patients. Results of the study included 13 studies, having a total of 778 patients included in a systematic review comprising ten RCTs and three quasi-experimental studies. Meta-analysis was performed on ten RCTs. The results showed a significant difference between the two groups regarding the use of music therapy in reducing the pain [standard mean difference (SMD) = -0.27; p = 0.002] and anxiety (SMD = -0.40; p = 0.0009). No statistically significant difference was found in the use of opioids and physiological variables between the two groups. Conclusion of the current evidence demonstrated that music therapy significantly reduces pain and anxiety among postoperative orthopedic patients. Researchers recommended using it in the routine care of orthopedic patients for managing their subjective feelings like pain and anxiety. Musical intervention timing, duration, and type of music can be changed according to specific clinical settings and medical teams."

        "Abstract":"Music intervention (MI) has been applied as an effective adjunctive treatment for pain control in various clinical settings. However, no meta-analysis has yet been published on the analgesic effects of MI in infants and children. We performed a systematic review of PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with the keywords \"pain\" AND \"music therapy\" from inception to January 2022. Primary outcomes were pain intensity and vital signs. Standardized mean difference (SMD) values and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were computed using a random effect model. Subgroup analyses with age groups, types of pain, and music styles were conducted. A total of 38 RCTs involving 5601 participants met the selection criteria. MI significantly decreased the pain levels (SMD = -0.57, p < 0.001), both in the newborn group (p = 0.007) and in the infant\/children group (p < 0.001). MI significantly reduced heart rate (SMD = -0.50, p < 0.001) and respiratory rate (SMD = -0.60, p = 0.002) and increased peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SMD = 0.44, p < 0.001). In subgroup analyses of types of pain, MI had significant effects on prick pain (p = 0.003), chronic and procedural pain (p < 0.001), and postoperative pain (p = 0.018). As for music styles, significant analgesic effects were observed for classical music (p < 0.001), kids' music (p < 0.001), and pop music (p = 0.001), but not for world music (p = 0.196), special composition (p = 0.092), and multiple music combinations (p = 0.420). In conclusion, our analysis provides supportive evidence about the efficacy of MI, especially classical, kids', and pop music, in controlling prick, procedural, and postoperative pain in the pediatric population."

Aim: The aim of this study was to assess the clinical effect of a live music therapy intervention on vital signs and levels of discomfort and pain for paediatric patients in the PICU. Methods: This was a quasi-experimental pretest-posttest study. The music therapy intervention was carried out by two music therapists who were specifically trained, each possessing a master's degree in the field of hospital music therapy. Ten minutes before the start of the music therapy session, the investigators recorded the vital signs of the patients and assessed their levels of discomfort and pain. The procedure was repeated at the start of the intervention; at 2, 5, and 10 min during the intervention; and at 10 min following the conclusion of the intervention. Results: Two hundred fifty-nine patients were included; 55.2% were male, with a median age of 1 year (0-21). A total of 96 (37.1%) patients suffered a chronic illness. The main reason for PICU admission was respiratory illness, at 50.2% (n = 130). Significantly lower values were observed for heart rate (p = 0.002), breathing rate (p < 0.001), and degree of discomfort (p < 0.001) during the music therapy session. Conclusions: Live music therapy results in reduced heart rates, breathing rates, and paediatric patient discomfort levels. Although music therapy is not widely used in the PICU, our results suggest that using interventions such as that used in this study could help reduce patient discomfort."

Moreover, it improves patient satisfaction and reduces postoperative pain. Thus, we intended to evaluate the effect of music intervention on the quality of comprehensive recovery using quality of recovery 40 (QoR-40) survey in patients undergoing gynecological laparoscopic surgery. Methods: Patients were randomly assigned to music intervention group or control group: 41 patients each. After anesthetic induction, headphones were placed on the patients, and then classical music selected by an investigator was started in the music group with individual comfortable volume during surgery, while the player was not started in the control group. On postoperatively 1 day, the QoR-40 (5 categories: emotions, pain, physical comfort, support, and independence) survey was evaluated, while postoperative pain, nausea, and vomiting were assessed at 30 minutes and 3, 24, and 36 hours postoperatively. Results: Total QoR-40 score was statistically better in the music group, and among the 5 categories, the music group had a higher pain category score than the control group. The postoperative pain score was significantly lower in the music group at 36 hours postoperatively, although the requirement for rescue analgesics was similar in both groups. The incidence of postoperative nausea did not differ at any time point. Conclusion: Intraoperative music intervention enhanced postoperative functional recovery and reduced postoperative pain in patients who underwent laparoscopic gynecological surgery."

        "Abstract":"Background: Emergency physicians face the challenge of relieving acute pain daily. While opioids are a potent treatment for pain, the opioid epidemic has ignited a search for nonopioid analgesic alternatives that may decrease the dose or duration of opioid exposure. While behavioral therapies and complementary medicine are effective, they are difficult to deploy in the emergency department. Music is a potential adjunctive therapy that has demonstrated effectiveness in managing pain. Objective: Our objective was to understand the feasibility and potential for an effect of a novel music app to address acute pain and anxiety in patients admitted to an emergency department observation unit. Methods: This prospective cohort study enrolled patients admitted to an emergency department observation unit with pain who had received orders for opioids. We gathered baseline pain and psychosocial characteristics including anxiety, sleep disturbance, and pain catastrophizing using validated questionnaires. Participants received a smartphone-based music intervention and listened to the music in either a supervised (research assistant-delivered music session 3 times during their stay) or unsupervised manner (music used ad lib by participant). The app collected premusic and postmusic pain and anxiety scores, and participants provided qualitative feedback regarding acceptability of operating the music intervention. Results: We enrolled 81 participants and randomly assigned 38 to an unsupervised and 43 to a supervised group. Mean pain in both groups was 6.1 (1.8) out of a possible score of 10. A total of 43 (53%) reported previous use of music apps at home. We observed an overall modest but significant decrease in pain (mean difference -0.81, 95% CI -0.45 to -1.16) and anxiety (mean difference -0.72, 95% CI -0.33 to -1.12) after music sessions. Reduction of pain and anxiety varied substantially among participants. Individuals with higher baseline pain, catastrophizing (about pain), or anxiety reported greater relief. Changes in pain were correlated to changes in anxiety (Pearson ρ=0.3, P=.02) but did not vary between supervised and unsupervised groups. Upon conclusion of the study, 46\/62 (74%) reported they liked the music intervention, 57\/62 (92%) reported the app was easy to use, and 49\/62 (79%) reported they would be willing to use the music intervention at home. Conclusions: A smartphone-based music intervention decreased pain and anxiety among patients in an emergency department observation unit, with no difference between supervised and unsupervised use. Individuals reporting the greatest reduction in pain after music sessions included those scoring highest on baseline assessment of catastrophic thinking, suggesting there may be specific patient populations that may benefit more from using music as an analgesic adjunct in the emergency department. Qualitative feedback suggested that this intervention was feasible and acceptable by emergency department patients."

        "Abstract":"Importance: Many medical procedures aimed at helping children cause them pain and distress, which can have long-lasting negative effects. Music is a form of distraction that may alleviate some of the pain and distress experienced by children while undergoing medical procedures. Objective: To compare music with standard care to manage pain and distress. Design, setting, and participants: Randomized clinical trial conducted in a pediatric emergency department with appropriate sequence generation and adequate allocation concealment from January 1, 2009, to March 31, 2010. Individuals assessing the primary outcome were blind to treatment allocation. A total of 42 children aged 3 to 11 years undergoing intravenous placement were included. Interventions: Music (recordings selected by a music therapist via ambient speakers) vs standard care. Main outcomes and measures: The primary outcome was behavioral distress assessed blinded using the Observational Scale of Behavioral Distress-Revised. The secondary outcomes included child-reported pain, heart rate, parent and health care provider satisfaction, ease of performing the procedure, and parental anxiety. Results: With or without controlling for potential confounders, we found no significant difference in the change in behavioral distress from before the procedure to immediately after the procedure. When children who had no distress during the procedure were removed from the analysis, there was a significantly less increase in distress for the music group (standard care group = 2.2 vs music group = 1.1, P < .05). Pain scores among children in the standard care group increased by 2 points, while they remained the same in the music group (P = .04); the difference was considered clinically important. The pattern of parent satisfaction with the management of children's pain was different between groups, although not statistically significant (P = .07). Health care providers reported that it was easier to perform the procedure for children in the music group (76% very easy) vs the standard care group (38% very easy) (P = .03). Health care providers were more satisfied with the intravenous placement in the music group (86% very satisfied) compared with the standard care group (48%) (P = .02). Conclusions and relevance: Music may have a positive impact on pain and distress for children undergoing intravenous placement. Benefits were also observed for the parents and health care providers. Trial registration: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00761033."

Methods: Electronic databases including PubMed, Cochrane Library, Scopus, and Web of Science were searched using the relevant MeSH terms. The inclusion criteria were all RCTs assessing the effect of music therapy versus no music in reducing anxiety during breast biopsy. The extracted outcomes were anxiety and pain during breast biopsy. They were pooled as mean difference (MD) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) in a fixed-effects model, using Review Manager 5.3 software for windows. The quality of included studies was assessed with the Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool (RoB 1.0). Then, the outcomes of our meta-analyses were independently evaluated by the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) to know the grade of their evidence. Results: The final analysis included five RCTs. We found a positive effect of music therapy in reducing anxiety levels compared with control group (MD = - 2.11; 95% CI (- 4.16 to - 0.06); p = 0.04). No difference between music and control groups regarding pain associated with breast biopsy (MD = 0.22; 95% CI (- 0.81 to 1.25); p = 0.68). The GRADE rating of our outcomes was low for anxiety levels and very low for pain during the biopsy. Conclusions: Music therapy could be an effective, simple, non-pharmacological option in relieving anxiety during breast biopsy; however, it had no effect on procedure-associated pain. More large and high-quality studies are needed to confirm our results."

Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs evaluating music-listening for pain management on adults was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses statement. The databases Pubmed, Scopus, SCIELO, SpringerLink, Global Health Library, Cochrane, EMBASE, and LILACS were searched. Studies published between 2004 and 2017 with quantified measurements of pain were included. Quality was evaluated using the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network methodology checklist for RCT, and effect sizes were reported with standardized mean differences. Results: A total of 85 studies were included for qualitative analysis but only 56.47% described at least one music characteristic. Overall meta-analysis found a significant effect, with high heterogeneity, of music for pain management (SMD -0.59, I2 = 85%). Only instrumentation characteristics (lack of lyrics, of percussion or of nature sounds), and 60-80 bpm tempo were described sufficiently for analysis. All three instrumentation characteristics had significant effects, but only the lack of lyrics showed an acceptable heterogeneity. Conclusions: Results show that music without lyrics is effective for the management of pain. Due to insufficient data, no ideal music characteristics for the management of pain were identified suggesting that music, as an intervention, needs standardization through an objective language such as that of music theory."

        "Abstract":"Background: Numerous meta-analyses have been conducted on the topic of music and pain, with the latest comprehensive study published in 2006. Since that time, more than 70 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been published, necessitating a new and comprehensive review. Objective: The aim of this meta-analysis was to examine published RCT studies investigating the effect of music on pain. Methods: The present study included RCTs published between 1995 and 2014. Studies were obtained by searching 12 databases and hand-searching related journals and reference lists. Main outcomes were pain intensity, emotional distress from pain, vital signs, and amount of analgesic intake. Study quality was evaluated according to the Cochrane Collaboration guidelines. Results: Analysis of the 97 included studies revealed that music interventions had statistically significant effects in decreasing pain on 0-10 pain scales (MD = -1.13), other pain scales (SMD = -0.39), emotional distress from pain (MD = -10.83), anesthetic use (SMD = -0.56), opioid intake (SMD = -0.24), non-opioid intake (SMD = -0.54), heart rate (MD = -4.25), systolic blood pressure (MD = -3.34), diastolic blood pressure (MD = -1.18), and respiration rate (MD = -1.46). Subgroup and moderator analyses yielded additional clinically informative outcomes. Conclusions: Considering all the possible benefits, music interventions may provide an effective complementary approach for the relief of acute, procedural, and cancer\/chronic pain in the medical setting."

        "Abstract":"Purpose: Wide-awake local anesthesia no-tourniquet (WALANT) hand surgery has gained popularity because of its cost savings, safety, favorable outcomes, and high patient satisfaction. However, the wide-awake nature of the technique causes many patients to experience anxiety during the procedure. Nonorthopedic studies have reported the anxiolytic effects of intraprocedural music in a variety of wide-awake medical procedures. This prospective randomized controlled trial investigated the effects of wearing noise-canceling headphones and listening to music on patient anxiety during WALANT hand surgery. Methods: Institutional review board approval was obtained. Patients were randomized to one of the following groups: (1) a headphones group that wore noise-canceling headphones and listened to music (genre of their choice) during the surgery, or (2) a control group that neither wore noise-canceling headphones nor listened to music during surgery. Patient anxiety was assessed on a 10-point visual analog scale before, during, and after surgery. All patients completed an overall experience questionnaire after surgery. Results: Fifty patients were enrolled, with 25 in each group. Both the groups were similar in terms of patient characteristics, diagnosed anxiety, and preoperative level of anxiety. The headphones group was found to have significantly less intraoperative anxiety (1.02 vs 2.32, respectively; P = .017) and a significantly greater net decrease in anxiety from the preoperative to intraoperative level (-1.78 vs -0.56, respectively; P = .033) than the control group. In the headphones group, 92% (23\/25) of patients stated that they would recommend wearing noise-canceling headphones and listening to music to other WALANT hand surgery patients. All (50\/50) patients in both groups reported that they would choose to undergo WALANT hand surgery again if needed for the same problem. Conclusions: The use of noise-canceling headphones with music during WALANT hand surgery significantly decreases intraoperative patient anxiety. This intervention represents an effective, safe, and inexpensive nonpharmacologic measure to improve patient anxiety and overall experience with WALANT hand surgery. Type of study\/level of evidence: Therapeutic I."

This study aimed to determine the effectiveness of music therapy combined with aromatherapy, in reducing the children's dental anxiety and fear. Materials and methods: A total of 128 school-age children aged 10-12 years were randomly allocated into 4 groups: a control group with 32 volunteers, an experimental group that received music therapy, with 33 volunteers, an aromatherapy experimental group with 31 volunteers, and 32 volunteers in an experimental group with music therapy combined with aromatherapy. Results: The results found that within-group comparisons before and after the experiment revealed the outcomes with a statistically significant change at the 0.05 level of each group as follows. The control group had increased heart rate. The music therapy group showed decreased dental anxiety and fear and systolic blood pressure. The aromatherapy experimental group exhibited increased oxygen saturation. The experimental group receiving music therapy combined with aromatherapy showed decreased dental anxiety and fear, heart rate, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure as well as increased oxygen saturation values. In addition, it was found that music therapy combined with aromatherapy had a co-influence on dental anxiety and fear (F = 22.22, P < 0.001) and oxygen saturation (F = 17.40, P < 0.001), and the two main treatments also significantly influenced these outcomes at the 0.05 level.

Objective: This pilot study investigates the efficacy of Multimodal Music Therapy (MMT), a combination of music therapy and cognitive-behavioral therapy, compared to treatment as usual (TAU). Methods: Thirty-six children aged 8-12 years with a primary diagnosis of an anxiety disorder were randomly assigned to 15 sessions of MMT or to TAU. Diagnostic status and dimensional outcome variables were assessed at the end of treatment and 4 months later. Results: MMT was superior compared to TAU according to the remission rates after treatment (MMT 67%; TAU 33%; chi2 = 4.0; p = 0.046) and remissions persisted until four months post-treatment. Dimensional measures showed equivalent improvement after either MMT or TAU. Conclusions: The results regarding the efficacy of MMT are promising for children with anxiety disorders. Further evaluation with larger samples and comparisons to pure CBT are recommended."

        "Abstract":"Purpose: Nursing students often experience anxiety and stress when taking exams that test their fundamental nursing skills. Complementary alternative methods, such as aromatherapy and music therapy, have effectively alleviated such negative emotions among nursing students. However, few studies have examined the effects of combined therapy interventions or compared the effects of different interventions. This study identified the individual and combined effects of aromatherapy and music therapy on test anxiety, state anxiety, stress, and fundamental nursing skills among nursing students in Korea. Methods: A double-blinded, randomized, controlled trial design was used. The study was conducted at the nursing college at Sungshin Women's University, Seoul, Republic of Korea. Ninety-eight sophomore female nursing students participated in the study. Subjects were randomly categorized under three groups: aromatherapy (n = 32), music therapy (n = 32), and aromatherapy combined with music therapy (n = 34). Aromatherapy was carried out through the inhalation method using an aroma lamp and three drops of Origanum majorana and Citrus sinensis. Music therapy was carried out using Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata. Twenty-minute interventions were performed in separate rooms before an exam was administered. Data were collected through self-report questionnaires, including demographics, test anxiety, state anxiety, and stress. Participants' Foley catheterization skill was likewise evaluated. Results: Aromatherapy combined with music therapy had a significant effect on test anxiety (F = 4.29, p = 0.016), state anxiety (F = 4.77, p = 0.011), stress (F = 4.62, p = 0.012), and performance of fundamental nursing skills (F = 8.04, p = 0.001) compared with aromatherapy and music therapy as separate interventions. Conclusions: The results suggest that nursing education that includes aromatherapy combined with music therapy may be effective for improving the performance of fundamental nursing skills and reducing anxiety and stress among nursing students."

        "Abstract":"Background: Cast room procedures, such as cast application and removal, pin removal, and suture removal can cause significant anxiety in young children. The use of music therapy in the cast room to decrease anxiety has not been previously reported. Methods: We performed a randomized, prospective study of soft lullaby music compared with no music in 69 children 10 years or younger undergoing cast room procedures. Heart rates (beats per minute) were recorded in the waiting room and cast room using a pulse oximeter. Results: A total of 28 children were randomized to music and 41 children to no music. The mean rise in heart rate between the waiting room and entering the cast room was -2.7 beats\/min in the music group and 4.7 beats\/min in the no music group (P = 0.001). The mean difference in heart rate between the waiting room and during the procedure was 15.3 beats\/min in the music group and 22.5 beats\/min in the no music group (P = 0.05). There were 7 patients in the no music group with heart rate increases of greater than 40 beats\/min. No patient in the music group had an increase of this magnitude. Conclusions: Playing soft music in the cast room is a simple and inexpensive option for decreasing anxiety in young children during cast room procedures. Level of evidence: Randomized Clinical Trial, Level II."

        "Abstract":"Objective: We aimed to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the effect of music therapy on anxiety and pregnancy rates among infertile women undergoing to perform assisted reproductive technologies (ART).Methods: Cochrane Library, PubMed, ISI web of science, and Scopus were searched from inception to May 2021. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared music therapy (intervention group) to no music intervention (control group). Our primary outcomes were anxiety score using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) tool and pain score utilizing the Visual Analog Scale (VAS). Our secondary outcomes were the overall satisfaction score and clinical pregnancy rate. We extracted the available data from included studies and pooled them in a meta-analysis model using RevMan software. The overall quality of evidence was assessed through GRADEpro GDT software.Results: Seven RCTs with a total number of 793 patients were included in our study. Music therapy significantly reduced the anxiety score compared to control group (MD= -3.09, 95% CI [-5.57, -0.61], p = 0.01). Moreover, pain score was significantly improved after music treatment (MD= -2.93, 95% CI [-3.86, -2.00], p > 0.001). A significant improvement in the overall satisfaction score was found among music therapy group (MD= 1.51, 95% CI [0.40, 2.61], p = 0.008). Although more women in music therapy group experienced an increase in the clinical pregnancy rate in comparison with control group, the result was not statistically significant (RR= 1.08, 95% CI [0.94, 1.26], p = 0.28). The GRADEpro GDT tool showed a moderate quality of evidence for the evaluated outcomes.Conclusions: There is evidence of moderate quality that music therapy improves anxiety, pain, and satisfaction scores among infertile women undergoing ART. Moreover, it increases the clinical pregnancy rate but without statistical significance. More trials with a larger sample size are needed to investigate the influence of music therapy on the clinical outcomes of ART."

        "Abstract":"Objective: The purpose of this study was to assess the effectiveness of music therapy in decreasing anxiety in ventilator-dependent patients. Design: A crossover repeated measures design with random assignment was used. Setting: The intensive care unit of a university hospital in Hong Kong was used as the setting for this study. Patients: Twenty patients who were ventilator-dependent were recruited for the study. They were all Chinese with a mean age of 58.25 years (range, 19-84 y). Most (75%) were men. Outcome measures: Physiologic measures of anxiety assessed in this study were mean blood pressure and respiratory rate. An additional measure was the Chinese version of the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Intervention: Patients were randomized to receive either 30 minutes of uninterrupted rest and then 30 minutes of music therapy or the music therapy first and then the uninterrupted rest period. Patients listened to relaxing music by using audiocassette players and headphones. Subjects selected the music of their choice from a selection including both Chinese and Western music. Subjects had physiologic measures taken immediately before the intervention (or rest period) and at 5-minute intervals throughout the intervention. The Chinese version of Spielberger's State-Trait Anxiety Inventory was completed before the intervention and immediately after the intervention. Results: Findings indicated that music therapy was more effective in decreasing state anxiety than was an uninterrupted rest period (P <.01). As measured by analysis of variance with repeated measures, blood pressure and respiratory rate showed no significant differences in the 2 conditions over time. However, significant differences were observed at the end of the intervention (after 30 minutes) between the 2 conditions, with music therapy being superior to the rest period. Conclusion: Music therapy is an effective nursing intervention in decreasing anxiety in ventilator-dependent patients and its use should be incorporated into the care of mechanically ventilated patients. For the Chinese patients, culture and language were the predominant factors in their choice of music."

The following electronic databases were utilized for selecting eligible studies that were published from inception to March 2021: PubMed, Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, Medline, Web of Science, and Embase. Standard mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence interval (CI) values were used to evaluate the efficacy of music therapy on anxiety. Thirty-two studies with 1,924 participants were included in the meta-analysis. Music therapy lasted an average of 7.5 sessions (range, 1-24 sessions), while the average follow-up duration was 7.75 weeks (range, 1-16 weeks). Music therapy significantly reduced anxiety compared to the control group at post-intervention (SMD = -0.36, 95% CI: -0.54 to -0.17, p < 0.05), but not at follow-up (SMD = -0.23, 95% CI: -0.53 to 0.08, p >0.05).

Our study indicated that music therapy can significantly improve anxiety during treatment. But given that only eight RCTs reported the effects of music therapy at follow-up and the duration of follow-up was inconsistent, further researches are needed on the lasting effects after the intervention is discontinued."

The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of introducing Music therapy on site with Covid-19 patients and investigating the immediate effects a single session has on anxiety, heart rate (HR), oxygen saturation (O2Sat) and satisfaction compared to standard care. A randomized controlled trial of 40 patients was conducted. Participants were assigned to control group (CG) or the treatment group (MG). MG received an individual single session of music therapy in presence. CG received standard care. MG and CG were subjected to identical measurements (pre-during-post) of the parameters STAI-Y, HR and O2Sat. Participants in MG were asked to fill in an optional open-ended question concerning their experience with music therapy. Significant difference in anxiety levels between scores in MG and CG (34.50 (23.25-40.00) vs 45.00(38, 25-54.00); p = 0.000) was observed. MG compared to CG had statistically significantly higher values of O2Sat (97.50 (96.25-99.00) versus 96.00 (96.00-98.00); p = 0.026). Results show the feasibility of introducing music therapy as a supporting complementary\/non-pharmacological intervention on site in Covid-19 patients. A single session of music therapy improves O2Sat and can significantly reduce anxiety.Trial registration: 14\/10\/2021 No. NCT05077306. https:\/\/www.clinicaltrials.cov ."

        "Abstract":"In order to explore and analyze the effect of music therapy interventions on college students with excessive anxiety, this paper selected 240 year 2017- to year 2020-enrolled undergraduates from a comprehensive university in Taiyuan City, Shanxi Province, in Central China as research objects. These college students had been diagnosed as excessive anxiety and were randomly divided into two groups-intervention group and control group-with 120 students in each group. The control group received conventional mental health treatment for college students, while the intervention group received music therapy interventions on this basis with 3 times a week for 24 times. The instruments used in the music therapy include piano, percussion instruments, melodic instruments, and diffuse instruments; the specific implementation of each therapy is divided into five parts: warm-up, rhythm percussion, song singing, instrumental ensemble, and music appreciation. The study results show that before treatment, the excessive anxiety score of college student in the control group was 63-76 with an average score of 72.58 ± 5.27; after treatment, that was 45-64 with an average score of 54.46 ± 6.82; before treatment, the excessive anxiety score of college student in the intervention group was 62-78 with an average score of 72.56 ± 5.51; after treatment, that was 26-44 with an average score of 33.19 ± 5.51. Before treatment, there was no significant difference in the excessive anxiety scores between the two groups of college students (P > 0.05); after treatment, the excessive anxiety scores of the two groups were lower than those before treatment, and the reduction degrees in the intervention group were bigger than those in the control group, with statistically significant difference (P < 0.05). Therefore, music therapy interventions can significantly reduce the excessive anxiety of college students; the analysis also shows that factors such as gender, grade, major, origin, repertoire type, therapy type, and anxiety type could affect the effect of music therapy interventions to some certain extent. For example, the effect of music therapy interventions on college students in psychology or related majors is better than that of students in other majors; the effect of receptive music therapy is better than that of creative and improvised music therapy; the effect of music therapy interventions on college students' life event, romantic relationship, and social anxiety is better than that on college students' test and job-hunting anxiety."

Methods: Twenty six patients were non-randomly allocated to either a music intervention group or a routine care group. The music intervention group received 60 minutes of music intervention for 15 sessions (1 or 2 times weekly). The outcomes were measured with Beck's Depression Inventory, the State and Trait Anxiety Inventory, and the Relationship Change Scale. Results: After 15 sessions, the music intervention group showed significant improvements in depression, anxiety, and relationships compared with the control group. Conclusions: These findings suggest that music can improve depression, anxiety, and relationships in psychiatric patients. However, we cannot elucidate the nonspecific effects. Furthermore, objective and replicable measures are required from a randomized controlled trial with a larger sample size and an active comparable control."

Method: The study was a randomized controlled trial. The study sample consisted of 64 elderly people who complied with the criteria of inclusion for the study. The data were collected using the 'Elderly Information Form' and 'Geriatric Depression Scale'. The music group listened to music three days in a week during 8 weeks. The depression levels were assessed at baseline (week 0) and follow-up in the eight week. Results: It was found that the difference between post-test depression scores of the two groups was found to be statistically significant (t = -2.86, p <.01). The mean scores of post-test systolic blood pressure in the music group were found to be significantly lower than those of the control group (t = -3.11, p < .05). Conclusion: It was concluded that music therapy decreased the depression level and systolic blood pressure in elderly people. The study results implies that music therapy can be an effective practice for public health and home care nurses attempting to reduce depression and control physiological parameters of elderly people."

        "Abstract":"Objective: Recent studies have thrown doubt on the true effectiveness of anti-depressants in light and moderate depression. The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of physical training and music therapy on a sample group of subjects affected by light to moderate depression versus subjects treated with pharmacological therapy only. Design and setting: Randomized controlled study. Patients were randomized into two groups. Subjects in the pharmacotherapy group received a therapy with antidepressant drugs; the exercise\/music therapy group was assigned to receive physical exercise training combined with listening to music. The effects of interventions were assessed by differences in changes in mood state between the two groups. Main outcome measures: Medically eligible patients were screened with the Hamilton Anxiety Scale and with the Geriatric Depression Scale. We used plasmatic cytokine dosage as a stress marker. Results: We recruited 24 subjects (mean age: 75.5 ± 7.4, 11 M\/13 F). In the pharmacotherapy group there was a significant improvement in anxiety only (p<0.05) at 6-months. In the exercise\/music therapy was a reduction in anxiety and in depression at 3-months and at 6-months (p<0.05). We noted an average reduction of the level of TNF-a from 57.67 (± 39.37) pg\/ml to 35.80 (± 26.18) pg\/ml. Conclusions: Our training may potentially play a role in the treatment of subjects with mild to moderate depression. Further research should be carried out to obtain more evidence on effects of physical training and music therapy in depressed subjects."

Aims To determine the efficacy of music therapy added to standard care compared with standard care only in the treatment of depression among working-age people. Method: Participants (n = 79) with an ICD-10 diagnosis of depression were randomised to receive individual music therapy plus standard care (20 bi-weekly sessions) or standard care only, and followed up at baseline, at 3 months (after intervention) and at 6 months. Clinical measures included depression, anxiety, general functioning, quality of life and alexithymia. Trial registration: ISRCTN84185937. Results: Participants receiving music therapy plus standard care showed greater improvement than those receiving standard care only in depression symptoms (mean difference 4.65, 95% CI 0.59 to 8.70), anxiety symptoms (1.82, 95% CI 0.09 to 3.55) and general functioning (-4.58, 95% CI -8.93 to -0.24) at 3-month follow-up. The response rate was significantly higher for the music therapy plus standard care group than for the standard care only group (odds ratio 2.96, 95% CI 1.01 to 9.02). Conclusions: Individual music therapy combined with standard care is effective for depression among working-age people with depression. The results of this study along with the previous research indicate that music therapy with its specific qualities is a valuable enhancement to established treatment practices."

Methods: PubMed (MEDLINE), Ovid-Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Clinical Evidence were searched to identify studies evaluating the effectiveness of music-based intervention on depression from inception to May 2020. Standardized mean differences (SMDs) were estimated with random-effect model and fixed-effect model. Results: A total of 55 RCTs were included in our meta-analysis. Music therapy exhibited a significant reduction in depressive symptom (SMD = -0.66; 95% CI = -0.86 to -0.46; P<0.001) compared with the control group; while, music medicine exhibited a stronger effect in reducing depressive symptom (SMD = -1.33; 95% CI = -1.96 to -0.70; P<0.001). Among the specific music therapy methods, recreative music therapy (SMD = -1.41; 95% CI = -2.63 to -0.20; P<0.001), guided imagery and music (SMD = -1.08; 95% CI = -1.72 to -0.43; P<0.001), music-assisted relaxation (SMD = -0.81; 95% CI = -1.24 to -0.38; P<0.001), music and imagery (SMD = -0.38; 95% CI = -0.81 to 0.06; P = 0.312), improvisational music therapy (SMD = -0.27; 95% CI = -0.49 to -0.05; P = 0.001), music and discuss (SMD = -0.26; 95% CI = -1.12 to 0.60; P = 0.225) exhibited a different effect respectively. Music therapy and music medicine both exhibited a stronger effects of short and medium length compared with long intervention periods. Conclusions: A different effect of music therapy and music medicine on depression was observed in our present meta-analysis, and the effect might be affected by the therapy process."

        "Abstract":"Background: Existing systematic reviews provide evidence that music therapy is an effective intervention in the treatment of children and adolescents with psychopathology. The objective of the present review was to systematically review and quantify the effects of music-based interventions in reducing internalizing symptoms (i.e., depression and anxiety) in children and adolescents using a meta-analytical approach. Methods: Databases and journals were systematically screened for studies eligible for inclusion in meta-analysis on the effects of music-based interventions in reducing internalizing symptoms. A random-effect meta-analysis using standardized mean differences (SMD) was conducted. Results: Five studies were included. Analysis of data from (randomized) controlled trials, yielded a significant main effect (Hedge's g = -0.73; 95%CI [-1.42;-0.04], Z = 2.08, p = 0.04, k = 5), indicating a greater reduction of internalizing symptoms in youth receiving music-based interventions (n = 100) compared to different control group interventions (n = 95). Limitations: The existing evidence is limited to studies of low power and methodological quality. Included studies were highly heterogeneous with respect to the nature of the intervention, the measurements applied, the samples studied, and the study design. Conclusions: Findings indicate that music-based interventions may be efficient in reducing the severity of internalizing symptoms in children and adolescents. While these results are encouraging with respect to the application of music-based intervention, rigorous research is necessary to replicate existing findings and provide a broader base of evidence. More research adopting well controlled study designs of high methodological quality is needed."

        "Abstract":"Background: The effect of different music interventions on depression in older adults is varied. We aimed to explore the comparative effect of different music intervention features on depression in older adults. Methods: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, CENTRAL, CINAHL, and ProQuest Dissertations&Theses from inception to October 2021 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of music interventions in participants aged ≥60 years. Music interventions were classified based on the TIP (theme, intensity, and provider\/platform) framework. The theme was divided into: 1) active music therapy (ACT); 2) receptive music therapy (Recep); and 3) music medicine (MM). The intensity was classified as high (>60 minutes\/week), and low (≤60 minutes\/week). The provider was classified as a music therapist (MT) or a non-music therapist (NonMT). Summary standardized mean differences (SMD) of level of depression with 95% confidence interval (CI) were estimated using a frequentist framework with a random-effects model. The certainty of evidence was evaluated using the Confidence in Network Meta-Analysis (CINeMA) approach. This study was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42021247165). Findings: Fifteen RCTs involving 1,144 older adults (mean age 67.9-86.6 years) were included. When compared with usual care, the most effective music intervention was active music therapy >60 minutes\/week by music therapist (Act\/High\/MT) (SMD -3.00; 95%CI, -3.64,-2.35), followed by music medicine >60 minutes\/week by non-music therapist (MM\/High\/NonMT) (SMD -2.06; 95%CI, -2.78,-1.35) with moderate and high certainty of evidence, respectively. Depression scores in older adults treated with ACT\/High\/MT was also significantly lower than all other interventions, except MM\/High\/NonMT. Low intensity music interventions other than Act\/Low\/MT had no impact on depression. Interpretation: Although active music therapy >60 minutes\/week by music therapist is the most effective intervention to alleviate depression in older adults, music medicine by listening to music of older adult's own preference >60 minutes\/week is an alternative approach in settings with limited resources. Funding: None."

        "Abstract":"Background: There is some evidence that Sufi music therapy might improve physical and mental well-being; however, no systematic review or meta-analysis has pooled and critiqued the evidence. The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the effects of Sufi music therapy on mental health outcomes. Methods: We searched Medline, PsycINFO, the Web of Science, Science Direct, PsycARTICLES, Cochrane Library, SCOPUS, CINAHL Plus, AMED, and ULAKBIM databases, and the reference lists of the studies found. Papers published in academic peer-reviewed journals were included, as well as from other sources such as chapters in edited books, the grey literature, or conference presentations. Articles published up to March 2020 in Turkish and English were included. Our primary outcome of interest was anxiety and secondary outcomes of interest were other mental health outcomes such as depression. To assess the methodological quality of the articles, the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool was used. The quality of evidence was assessed using the GRADEpro GDT system. Results: This search yielded 21 clinical trials that were eligible for inclusion. A meta-analysis, using a random effects model, of 18 randomised controlled trials involving 1454 participants showed that Sufi music therapy with makams, compared with treatment as usual (TAU) or a no-music control group, reduced symptoms of anxiety in the short term in patients undergoing an operation or treatments such as chemotherapy or haemodialysis (standardised mean difference SMD= -1.15, 95 % CI, -1.64 to -0.65; very low-quality evidence). The evidence of Sufi music with makam's effect on anxiety is rated as very low. Qualitative synthesis of secondary outcomes revealed significant effects for depression, positive symptoms in schizophrenia, stress, which however were based on fewer studies. Trials were of moderate methodological quality, and there was significant heterogeneity across the studies. Conclusion: Sufi music may reduce anxiety of patients undergoing medical procedures like haemodialysis, coronary artery surgery, angiography, colonoscopy, bone marrow aspiration and biopsy procedures. Evidence from single studies suggests effects on depression and stress as well. However, due to methodological limitations of the studies, further, higher quality studies are required in other cultures."

        "Abstract":"Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine the feasibility and preliminary effects of a vocal music therapy (VMT) program on chronic pain management. Design: A mixed methods intervention design was used in which qualitative data were embedded within a randomized controlled trial. Setting: An urban nurse-management health center on the East Coast of the United States. Subjects: Participants (N = 43) were predominantly Black (79%) and female (76.7%) with an average pain duration of 10 years. Intervention: Participants were randomly allocated to a 12-week VMT program or a waitlist control. Outcome measures: We tracked consent rate (percentage of participants enrolled out of total number screened), attrition rate, and treatment adherence. We used PROMIS® (Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System) tools to measure pain interference, pain-related self-efficacy, pain intensity, depression, anxiety, positive effect, and well-being, ability to participate in social activities, and satisfaction with social roles at baseline and week 12. VMT participants also completed the Patient Global Impression of Change Scale. We conducted semistructured interviews to better understand participants' experience of the intervention. Results: The consent rate was 56%. The attrition rate was 23%. Large treatment effects (partial eta squared) were obtained for self-efficacy (0.20), depression (0.26), and ability to participate in social activities (0.24). Medium effects were found for pain intensity (0.10), anxiety (0.06), positive effect, and well-being (0.06), and small effects for pain interference (0.03) and satisfaction with social roles (0.03). On average, participants felt moderately better after completion of the VMT program (M = 4.93, standard deviation = 1.98). Qualitative findings suggest that VMT resulted in better self-management of pain, enhanced psychological well-being, and stronger social and spiritual connections. Conclusions: Recruitment into the 12-week program was challenging, but quantitative and qualitative findings suggest significant benefits of VMT for chronic pain management."

Effective interventions for the rehabilitation and facilitation of return to work are needed. Objective: The aim of the study was to examine the effects of Guided Imagery and Music (GIM), a psychotherapy intervention including relaxation, music listening, and imagery, on biopsychosocial measures of work-related stress. Methods: Twenty Danish workers on sick leave were randomized to music therapy versus wait-list control. Data collection was carried out at an occupational health ward in the period 2008-2010. Changes in salivary cortisol, testosterone, and melatonin were explored, and self-reported data on psychological stress symptoms (perceived stress, mood disturbance, sleep quality, physical distress symptoms, work readiness, well-being, anxiety, depression, immediate stress) were collected. Data regarding sick leave situation and job return were collected from participants throughout the study. Results: Significant beneficial effects of GIM compared to wait-list after nine weeks with large effect sizes were found in well-being, mood disturbance, and physical distress, and in cortisol concentrations with a medium effect size. A comparison between early and late intervention as related to the onset of sick leave showed faster job return and significantly improved perceived stress, well-being, mood disturbance, depression, anxiety, and physical distress symptoms in favor of early intervention. In the whole sample, 83% of the participants had returned to work at nine weeks' follow-up. Conclusions: The results indicate that GIM is a promising treatment for work-related chronic stress, and further studies are recommended."

However, there is little research on the use of music therapy with pediatric chronic pain conditions such as amplified pain syndromes. The purpose of the current study was to examine the effects of 3 specific music therapy interventions (active music engagement, live patient-selected music, and music-assisted relaxation) on anxiety and relaxation levels in youth (ages 10-18) participating in a 40 hr per week hospital-based intensive interdisciplinary pain treatment program. A sample of 48 patients participated in this study which utilized a 3-period, 3-treatment cross-over design with 3 interventions delivered in a quasi-randomized order determined by when the patients started the treatment program. State anxiety was measured via the state form of the State-Trait Inventory for Cognitive and Somatic Anxiety for Children and relaxation scores were assessed with a Visual Analog Scale. Statistically significant changes were found in anxiety and relaxation outcomes across all interventions provided. Results suggest that music therapy services (using active music engagement, live patient-selected music, and music-assisted relaxation) may be an effective modality to decrease anxiety and increase relaxation levels in pediatric patients with amplified pain syndromes."

A quasi-experimental study, repeated measures design was used. Thirty patients, aged 18-70 years, with neuropathic pain and hospitalized in an Algology clinic were identified as a convenience sample. Participants received 60 minutes of music therapy. Classical Turkish music was played to patients using a media player (MP3) and headphones. Participants had pain scores taken immediately before the intervention and at the 30th and 60th minutes of the intervention. Data were collected over a 6-month period in 2012. The patients' mean pain intensity scores were reduced by music, and that decrease was progressive over the 30th and 60th minutes of the intervention, indicating a cumulative dose effect. The results of this study implied that the inclusion of music therapy in the routine care of patients with neuropathic pain could provide nurses with an effective practice for reducing patients' pain intensity."

However, the effect of pharmacological treatment is not satisfying. Therefore, we analyzed the efficacy of music therapy in elderly dementia patients, and if so, whether music therapy can be used as first-line non-pharmacological treatment. A comprehensive literature search was performed on PubMed, EMbase and the Cochrane Library from inception to September 2016. A total of 34 studies (42 analyses, 1757 subjects) were included; all of them had an acceptable quality based on the PEDro and CASP scale scores. Studies based on any type of dementia patient were combined and analyzed by subgroup. The standardized mean difference was -0.42 (-0.74 to -0.11) for disruptive behavior and 0.20 (-0.09 to 0.49) for cognitive function as primary outcomes in random effect models using controls as the comparator; the secondary outcomes were depressive score, anxiety and quality of life. No evidence of publication bias was found based on Begg's and Egger's test. The meta-analysis confirmed that the baseline differences between the two groups were balanced. Subgroup analyses showed that disease sub-type, intervention method, comparator, subject location, trial design, trial period and outcome measure instrument made little difference in outcomes. The meta-regression may have identified the causes of heterogeneity as the intervention method, comparator and trial design. Music therapy was effective when patients received interactive therapy with a compared group. There was positive evidence to support the use of music therapy to treat disruptive behavior and anxiety; there were positive trends supporting the use of music therapy for the treatment of cognitive function, depression and quality of life. This study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42016036153."

        "Abstract":"Aims and objectives: To provide a meta-analysis of the effects of music interventions on patients with dementia, separating, for the first time, between different types of interventions and different outcome measures, namely affective, behavioural, cognitive and physiological. Background: Music therapy is an attractive form of intervention for the growing number of demented patients, for whom pharmacological interventions are not always effective and may lead to undesired side effects. While music is more frequently applied in clinical settings for each year, no meta-analysis has considered effects of music interventions on affective, behavioural, cognitive and physiological outcomes separately. Design: A standard meta-analysis approach was applied. Methods: We include all original studies found for the key words music and dementia. Mean effect sizes and confidence intervals are computed from study effect sizes according to standard methods, and these are considered for various common types of music interventions separately. Results: Nineteen studies with a total of 478 dementia patients exhibit effect sizes ranging from 0·04-4·56 (M = 1·04). Many of these indicate large positive effects on behavioural, cognitive and physiological outcome measures, and medium effects on affective measures. Conclusions: Music interventions seem to be effective and have the potential of increasing the quality of life for patients with dementia. Many studies in this area suffer from poor methodological quality, which limits the reach of meta-analysis and the strength and generalisability of these conclusions. Relevance to clinical practice: Being inexpensive and largely without adverse side effects, current knowledge seems to indicate that music interventions can be recommended for patients in all stages of dementia."

        "Abstract":"A recent qualitative review of literature in the area of music\/ music therapy and dementias published since 1985 suggested that music\/music therapy is an effective intervention for maintaining and improving active involvement, social, emotional and cognitive skills, and for decreasing behavioral problems of individuals with dementias (Brotons, Koger, & Pickett-Cooper, 1997). The present analysis sought to update and quantify this relationship, and investigate the extent to which methodological variables influenced treatment effectiveness. Twenty-one empirical studies, with a total of 336 subjects suffering from symptoms of dementia, were included in the meta-analysis. Overall, the effect of music\/music therapy was found to be highly significant. A homogeneity analysis determined that the effect sizes were not consistent across studies; thus, a series of moderating variable analyses were conducted. We were unable to determine the source of variability between studies by analyzing type of therapeutic intervention (active or passive), music (live or taped), therapist's training (trained music therapist vs. other professional), dependent variable (behavioral, cognitive, or social), or length of treatment. Although the published literature demonstrates that music\/music therapy is an effective method overall for treating symptoms of dementia, systematic variation of treatment protocols is necessary to identify the underlying mechanisms and delineate the most effective techniques."

The impact of music therapy on the global cognition of patients with dementia is controversial now. Objective: To explore whether music therapy has an effect on the global cognitive function of patients with dementia. Methods: PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Google Academy and National Knowledge Infrastructure were systematically searched to collect all literature studies published since the establishment of the database until November 2020. All randomized controlled trials that met the criteria of music therapy in the intervention group and standard care in the control group with outcome measures of Mini-mental State Examination (MMSE) were included. Analysis was performed using Stata 16.0. Results: The results showed that compared with the control group, the MMSE score in the music therapy group was generally higher (MD = 0.86, 95% CI: 0.07-1.66, P = 0.03). Conclusions: The result of this study differs from those of previous relevant meta-analyses, suggesting that music therapy is likely to improve the global cognitive function of patients with dementia, but more rigorous clinical trials are still needed to provide more sufficient and real evidence."

        "Abstract":"Background: Dementia is a neurological condition characterized by deterioration in cognitive, behavioral, social, and emotional functions. Pharmacological interventions are available but have limited effect in treating many of the disease's features. Several studies have proposed therapy with music as a possible strategy to slow down cognitive decline and behavioral changes associated with aging in combination with the pharmacological therapy. Objective: We performed a systematic review and subsequent meta-analysis to check whether the application of music therapy in people living with dementia has an effect on cognitive function, quality of life, and\/or depressive state. Methods: The databases used were Medline, PubMed Central, Embase, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Library. The search was made up of all the literature until present. For the search, key terms, such as \"music,\" \"brain,\" \"dementia,\" or \"clinical trial,\" were used. Results: Finally, a total of eight studies were included. All the studies have an acceptable quality based on the score on the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) and Critical Appraisal Skills Program (CASP) scales. After meta-analysis, it was shown that the intervention with music improves cognitive function in people living with dementia, as well as quality of life after the intervention and long-term depression. Nevertheless, no evidence was shown of improvement of quality of life in long-term and short-term depression. Conclusion: Based on our results, music could be a powerful treatment strategy. However, it is necessary to develop clinical trials aimed to design standardized protocols depending on the nature or stage of dementia so that they can be applied together with current cognitive-behavioral and pharmacological therapies."

        "Abstract":"Aims and objectives: To (1) perform a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials pertaining to the efficacy of music therapy on disruptive behaviours, anxiety levels, depressive moods and cognitive functioning in people with dementia; and (2) clarify which interventions, therapists and participant characteristics exerted higher and more prominent effects. Background: Present study was the first to perform a meta-analysis that included all the randomised controlled trials found in literature relating to music therapy for people with dementia over the past 15 years. Design: A meta-analysis study design. Methods: Quantitative studies were retrieved from PubMed, Medline, Cochrane Library Database, CINAHL, SCOPUS and PsycINFO. A meta-analysis was used to calculate the overall effect sizes of music therapy on outcome indicators. Results: Music therapy significantly improved disruptive behaviours [Hedges' g = -0·66; 95% confidence interval (CI) = -0·44 to -0·88] and anxiety levels (Hedges' g = -0·51; 95% CI = -0·02 to -1·00) in people with dementia. Music therapy might affect depressive moods (Hedges' g = -0·39; 95% CI = 0·01 to -0·78), and cognitive functioning (Hedges' g = 0·19; 95% CI = 0·45 to -0·08). Conclusion: Music therapy exerted a moderately large effect on disruptive behaviours of people with dementia, a moderate effect on anxiety levels and depressive moods, and a small effect on cognitive functioning. Relevance to clinical practice: Individual music therapy provided once a week to patients with cognitive functioning and manual guided in music intervention construction is suggested. Group music therapy is provided several times a week to reduce their disruptive behaviours, anxiety levels and depressive moods. Music therapy is a cost-effective, enjoyable, noninvasive therapy and could be useful for clinical nurses in creating an environment that is conducive to the well-being of patients with dementia."

        "Abstract":"Background: Aberrant motor behaviour or wandering refers to aimless movement without a specific purpose. Wandering is common in patients with dementia and leads to early institutionalization and caregivers' burden. Non-pharmacological interventions should be also considered as a first-line solution for the wandering because current pharmacological treatment has serious side-effects. Methods: A cross-over randomised controlled trial (RCT) with 60 participants of all stages and different types of dementia was conducted in Greece. The sample was randomly assigned in 6 different groups of 10 participants each. Every intervention lasted for 5 days, and there were 2 days as a wash-out period. There was no drop-out rate. The measurements used were the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination Revised (ACE-R), Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), Functional Rating Scale for Symptoms in Dementia (FRSSD), and Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI). The interventions that were evaluated were reminiscence therapy (RT), music therapy (MT), and physical exercise (PE). Results: NPI scores were reduced in the group receiving PE (p = 0.006). When MT (p = 0.018) follows PE, wandering symptoms are reduced further. RT should follow MT in order to reduce wandering more (p = 0.034). The same combination was effective for the caregivers' burden as well; PE (p = 0.004), MT (p = 0.036), RT (p = 0.039). Conclusions: An effective combination that can reduce wandering symptoms in all stages and types of dementia was found: The best order was PH-MT-RT. The same combination in the same order reduced caregivers' burden."

        "Abstract":"Objectives: This study explored the effectiveness of group music intervention against agitated behavior in elderly persons with dementia. Methods: This was an experimental study using repeated measurements. Subjects were elderly persons who suffered from dementia and resided in nursing facilities. In total, 104 participants were recruited by permuted block randomization and of the 100 subjects who completed this study, 49 were in the experimental group and 51 were in the control group. The experimental group received a total of twelve 30-min group music intervention sessions, conducted twice a week for six consecutive weeks, while the control group participated in normal daily activities. In order to measure the effectiveness of the therapeutic sessions, assessments were conducted before the intervention, at the 6th and 12th group sessions, and at 1 month after cessation of the intervention. Longitudinal effects were analyzed by means of generalized estimating equations (GEEs). Results: After the group music therapy intervention, the experimental group showed better performance at the 6th and 12th sessions, and at 1 month after cessation of the intervention based on reductions in agitated behavior in general, physically non-aggressive behavior, verbally non-aggressive behavior, and physically aggressive behavior, while a reduction in verbally aggressive behavior was shown only at the 6th session. Conclusions: Group music intervention alleviated agitated behavior in elderly persons with dementia. We suggest that nursing facilities for demented elderly persons incorporate group music intervention in routine activities in order to enhance emotional relaxation, create inter-personal interactions, and reduce future agitated behaviors."

A systematic review with a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials. The databases surveyed include AgeLine, CINAHL, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PubMed, and Cochrane. Seven studies were included in this review. The result revealed that music therapy significantly reduced depression at six, eight, and 16 weeks. This study also supported that music therapy significantly improved depression when the results of six studies with medium-term interventions were pooled. However, no evidence of effect of music therapy on depression was observed at three, four, 12 weeks, and five months during intervention, and one and two months after the cease of music therapy. Music therapy without a music therapist involved did not significantly reduce depression at any time. Medium-term of music therapy might be appropriate in reducing depression for people with dementia."

Twenty elderly (3 male & 17 female) who were diagnosed as having dementia and residing at 2 different residential care facilities in Florida were assigned to 1 of 4 small groups. Each of the participants served as his or her own control in an O1 O2 X O3 design. The depressive symptoms were measured using Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia. The differences between the scores of pretest, posttest 1 after a week of 5-day no treatment, and posttest 2 after a week of 5-day reminiscence focused music therapy treatment were compared. A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Newman-Keuls Multiple Comparison Procedure indicated statistically significant differences between pretest and posttest 2 as well as posttest 1 and posttest 2, while no significant differences were found between pretest and posttest 1. Results indicated that participation in small group reminiscence focused music therapy groups might help to reduce depressive symptoms in elderly people with dementia. Results of behavioral observations and future implications are also discussed."

Although music therapy is considered a non-pharmacological intervention for the management of BPSD, its effectiveness remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the effects of music therapy on BPSD, cognitive function, and activities of daily living in patients with dementia. A literature search was conducted in the following databases: MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and Igaku Chuo Zasshi. We selected 20 studies, including randomized controlled trials, controlled clinical trials, cohort studies, and controlled trials, and conducted a meta-analysis using standardized mean differences (SMD). The results showed that music therapy had moderate effects on anxiety [SMD, -0.64; 95% confidence interval (CI), -1.05 - -0.24; p=0.002] and small effects on behavioral symptoms (SMD, -0.49; 95% CI, -0.82 - -0.17; p=0.003). In studies of duration >3 months, music therapy had large effects on anxiety (SMD, -0.93; 95% CI, -1.72 - -0.13; p=0.02). The present systematic review and meta-analysis suggests that music therapy is effective for the management of BPSD."

Even with pharmacological treatment, behaviors often persist, hindering quality of life for elders, their family, and paid caregivers. This study examined the use of music therapy for treatment of these symptoms among 132 people with moderate to severe dementia in nursing homes. Participants were evaluated for depressive symptoms, agitation, and wandering to determine their predominate behavior. There were two assessments, two weeks apart, prior to intervention, followed by a two-week intervention, and two follow-up assessments, also two weeks apart. A repeated measures ANOVA determined that after two weeks of music therapy, symptoms of depression and agitation were significantly reduced; there was no change for wandering. Multivariate analyses confirmed a relationship between music therapy and change in neuropsychiatric symptoms associated with dementia. Results suggest widespread use of music therapy in long-term care settings may be effective in reducing symptoms of depression and agitation."

        "Abstract":"Aim: The clinical effectiveness of non-pharmacological interventions on behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) among older Chinese with dementia remains unclear, and the evidence supporting the benefits of a non-pharmacological approach on psychotic symptoms is scarce. Methods: A prospective cohort study including 104 older men with dementia living in two veterans homes in Taiwan was carried out in 2011. An organized program of music therapy, orientation training, art-cognitive activities and physical activities was carried out for the intervention group. All participants were evaluated for neuropsychiatric inventory (NPI), defined daily dose of psychotropic drug use, Barthel Index, Instrumental Activities of Daily Living, Mini-Mental State Examination, Geriatric Depression Scale, Tinetti balance score and Tinetti gait score. Results: Overall, 104 residents were enrolled and 92 of them completed the study. The intervention group had a more significant reduction than the reference group in the overall NPI score (-2.36, P = 0.046), and in the subcategories of delusion (-0.9, P = 0.018), hallucination (-0.82, P = 0.004) and agitation (-0.91, P = 0.038). Multivariate analysis showed that the non-pharmacological intervention was associated with a favorable outcome in overall NPI score (OR 4.113, P = 0.013) and in the subcategories of hallucination (OR 14.309, P = 0.049) and agitation (OR 6.604, P = 0.037). Meanwhile, a higher baseline NPI score was also associated with a favorable outcome in overall NPI score, and in the subcategories of delusion, hallucination and agitation. Conclusion: Non-pharmacological interventions have a positive effect on behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia, not only in outward symptoms like agitation, but also intrinsic psychotic symptoms like hallucination and delusion, and agitation in older Chinese men with dementia."

        "Abstract":"Background: Psychosocial interventions for people with dementia and their family caregivers together may sustain relationship quality and social connection. No previous music therapy research has examined the effects of group therapeutic songwriting (TSW) attended by people with dementia\/family caregiver dyads. Methods: This pre-post feasibility study aimed to examine the acceptability of a group TSW intervention for people with dementia\/family caregiver dyads and test the sensitivity of the following outcomes: Quality of the Caregiver-Patient Relationship (QCPR, primary); Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia (CSDD) and Quality of Life-Alzheimer's Dementia for people with dementia, Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Assessment of Quality of Life-8 Dimensions (AQoL-8D); and Zarit Burden Interview for family caregivers. Six weekly 1 h sessions guided participants to identify preferred music, brainstorm ideas, create lyrics, and record songs. Qualitative interviews were conducted with dyads who completed the intervention. Results: Fourteen dyads were recruited and completed baseline assessments. Participants with dementia were aged 62-92 years (M = 77, SD = 11). Caregiver participants (11 spouses, two daughters, one son) were aged 54-92 years (M = 67, SD = 10.1). Four dyads withdrew owing to declining health or inconvenience before the program commenced (n = 2) and after attending 1-2 sessions (n = 2). Ten dyads formed four homogeneous TSW groups (71% completion). No statistically significant changes were detected for any measure. High QCPR ratings at baseline (M = 57.1) and follow-up (M = 57.4) demonstrated sustained relationship quality. For participants with dementia, large effect sizes for the CSDD suggested trends toward decreased depression (d = -0.83) and improved mood (d = -0.88). For family caregivers, a large effect size suggested a trend toward improvement for the AQoL-8D sub-domain examining independent living (d = -0.93). Qualitative data indicated that session design and delivery were acceptable, and TSW was a positive shared experience with personal benefits, which supported rather than changed relationship quality. Conclusion: High retention and qualitative data indicate that TSW was well received by participants. Effect sizes suggest that group TSW for dyads may have beneficial impacts on depression for people with dementia and quality of life for family caregivers. Future research with a fully powered sample is recommended to further examine the psychosocial impacts of group TSW for people living with dementia\/family caregiver dyads."

        "Abstract":"Family caregivers often feel ill-equipped to handle bothersome behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia, such as agitation, apathy, and sleep disturbances, leading to increased caregiver distress and nursing home placement for people with dementia. Therapies for such symptoms are currently limited and non-pharmacological options are preferred, given potential side effects of medications. Neurologic music therapy (NMT) could provide an additional treatment option for managing behavioral and psychological symptoms for community-dwelling people with dementia and their caregivers. This pilot study sought to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of home-based NMT for behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia. Eighteen persons with dementia-caregiver dyads were enrolled to receive one-hour weekly sessions of home-based NMT for 6 weeks. Demographic, quality of life, neuropsychiatric symptom, and caregiver burden and self-efficacy information was collected at baseline, 6 weeks, and 12 weeks. Seven dyads (38.9%) withdrew from therapy before completing all sessions; these participants had higher Neuropsychiatric Inventory scores and were of older age at baseline. For those who completed therapy, neuropsychiatric symptom scores improved at 6 weeks, an effect that was sustained at 12 weeks. No other outcome measures changed significantly after therapy. Initiating NMT too late in the course of dementia, when behavioral symptoms are already present, may be impractical for people with dementia and increase caregiver stress, even when provided within the home. Introducing and incorporating the principles of NMT earlier in the course of dementia could allow for increased comfort and benefit for people with dementia and their caregivers."
